The first thing that is required in order to begin developing the game will be to ensure everything is set up correctly. Firstly, if not already, follow the steps outlined [HERE](/posts/unreal/learn-unreal/setup) in order to install and get familiar with basic functionality in the editor.

# Creating the Project #

First step is to create the project. This is straightforward enough, just make sure the settings are as shown in the screenshot below.

# Accessing Content #

All of the assets (called "content") in an Unreal project can be accessed by clicking on the **Content Drawer** at the bottom of the window which will cause the browser to pop up.

All of the starter content that comes with a blank project (because we checked the Starter Content checkbox) is located under the **StarterContent** folder.

Specifically, the maps (scenes) are located under the **Maps** subfolder. The maps are those that are highlighted in the image, with the gold line below them.

# Level Graph #

The next post will focus more on using the blueprint graph, but as a quick overview we can use blueprints graphs for individual actors in the scene, but also for the scene itself.

In order to open the level blueprint graph click this at the top of the editor

This opens the blueprint editor, which can be docked into the main window as a tab. Looks like this

By right-clicking as it says, we get access to all of the nodes available, sorted nicely into folders - and we can search for those we know the names of
