Currently we have an unlimited amount of ammo, however we want to only provide a limited amount of ammo for this test game (say 20).

We therefore need a variable to hold the amount of ammo we have left, decrement it when we fire a projectile, and when we hit 0 print out of ammo rather than spawning one.

## Adding An Ammo Variable

First thing is first, we need to add a variable to hold the amount of ammo we have left.

Opening up the level blueprint, we can see that there is a **My Blueprint** panel and one section of that is for **Variables**.

Let's add a new variable and call it Ammo and change the type to Integer as we are storing integers.

Note that we can't set a default value yet as it says we must compile the blueprint.

We can do that with the circled button below, and then set a default value of 20 to start with 20 ammo.

And then set a default value of 20 to start with 20 ammo.

## Decrementing Ammunition

Next, we want to decrement the ammo count every time a projectile is spawned.

Let's go ahead and drag the variable into the event graph, which asks us if we want a getter or a setter. Here we want a setter!

We can do the same again to get a getter. We want to set the ammo value to be 1 less than what it currently is.

After decrementing we print out the remaining amount of ammo.

This section of the event graph shows how to do it.

![[Subtract 1 From Ammo Every Time We Fire.png]]

We can now see that it prints on screen 1 less each time we fire.

## Problem!

There is a problem with the current setup. We don't terminate the decrementing when we reach 0 ammo. This means that we can go into the negative numbers as shown below if we keep firing.

## Solution

To solve this, we need to use a **branch** node which allows us to only spawn a projectile (and decrement) if we have ammo.

If we are at 0 ammo we should go ahead and print **Out Of Ammo** instead.

The following setup shows how to do this.

![[Fix For Out Of Ammo.png]]

Here we check if the ammo count is equal to 0 and if it is, then we print "Out Of Ammo!" instead. Otherwise we go ahead and spawn as before.

This fixes the issue and as soon as we hit 0 we no longer are able to spawn a projectile.
