In the [[7. Spawning|Previous Section]] we were able to get a cannonball to spawn at a fixed location, however we need to be able to have these cannonballs be launched forwards from the camera regardless of its facing and positioning.

In order to do this, we need to do 3 things:
1. Set the spawning position of the cannonball to the player's position
2. Rotate the cannonball so that it faces in the same direction as the player
3. Apply the impulse along the **forward vector** of the spawned cannonball so that it fires in the correct direction

# Positioning

The first thing we should do is to be able to get the player position, and feed it to the spawning of the cannonball/projectile. 

In Blueprints this is actually very easy, and consists of two steps:
1. Get the player pawn
2. Get the position of this actor

For #1 there is a node called **Get Player Pawn** which takes an index. Since we only have one player, we leave it at index 0. It returns the pawn actor of the player at that index.

For #2 we can use the **Get Actor Position** node to get the position of the pawn we received.

When we change our level blueprint to put these into place, it looks as follows.

# Rotating

Now that we've positioned the spawned projectile, we will need to go ahead and ensure it's correctly rotated.

We can't however get the rotation of the player pawn as **by default** it does not rotate with the camera.

We instead need to get the **control rotation** but this is just a case of using the same pawn but with a different node.

In the graph this looks like follows.

# Changing Impulse

The final piece is to make sure the impulse is applied in the correct direction. This is easy since we've rotated the projectile to face forward (in the same direction as the camera), we just need to get the forward vector.

We can do this with the **Get Actor Forward Vector** node which returns a unit vector. However since we want the impulse to be more than a single unit in strength - we can use the **Multiply** node to scale the length of the vector.

The multiply node by default when dropped will have a second input pin as a vector. We can change this by right clicking the pin.

After hooking everything up in the graph we get the following.

# Changing Projectile Mass

Currently the mass of the spawned projectile is a little too light to act as a cannonball and push geometry around.

We can simply go into the blueprint class for the projectile (BP_Projectile) and check the box to override the mass of the object manually.

# Results

After all of the above, we now are able to fire/spawn the cannonballs at the camera position and rotation, and fire them forwards away from the camera.
