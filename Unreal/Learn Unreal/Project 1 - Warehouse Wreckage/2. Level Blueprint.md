After setting up the project and getting used to the editor, the next thing to do is to start getting comfy with the blueprint graph editor, and hook up some basic nodes to see how it all works. However, there is one thing that we will need to do from UE version 5.1 and onwards.

# Duplicating the Starter Map #

From UE 5.1 and onwards, the StarterContent folder is re-initialised on startup and any changes would be lost. Therefore in order to edit one of the existing maps which we'll do for testing purposes, we'll first need to duplicate the **Minimal_Default** map which can be done by right-clicking it in the Content Drawer and choosing to duplicate.

Next we'll create a new folder in the Content folder which is also easy enough from the right-click menu.

I've created a CustomContent folder, with a Maps folder underneath to mimic the structure of the StarterContent.

We can then drag-n-drop the map from the StarterContent/Maps folder into the CustomContent/Maps folder

Then double-click the newly duplicated map to open it for editing - we'll work with that for now!

# Adding the First Node #

Open up the level blueprint as explained at the end of the last section, and right-click to get the node selection dialog.

We can search for a node by text, then click on it to drop it into the graph.

In the above image, I am searching for the **Print String** node, adding it to the graph, and then change the string that is printed by clicking on the box on the node itself.

# Adding an Event Node #

The entry points into the **Event Graph** are (as the name implies), the **event** nodes. There are a lot of different event nodes, but for testing purposes right now, will just use the node called **BeginPlay**.

That can be hooked up by clicking on the event node's output pin, and dragging to connect it to the print node's input pin as shown in the diagram above.

# Result #

Now when we click play to run the level, we can see the debug string printed in the top left corner
