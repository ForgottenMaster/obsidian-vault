In Unity there's the concept of having a prefab which is a template for a GameObject to be spawned. Unreal has a similar concept although they're called **Blueprint Classes**. This small post is showing how to convert an existing actor into a blueprint class which can then be instantiated multiple times.

# Adding a Sphere #

Firstly we can start off by adding a sphere actor as just a standalone actor in the scene. We do this the same way we added a cube to the scene.

However the sphere is a little too big in its default state, so we can use the scaling tool to make it smaller. Click the grey box in the center of the scaling gizmo to scale on all axes uniformly.

# Converting to a Blueprint Class #

Now we have an actor in the scene, we can go ahead and turn it into a blueprint class (prefab) which will then let us instantiate more copies as needed. Just like Unity prefabs, we can drag and drop them from the content drawer, or duplicate a prefab instance in the scene.

In order to make a blueprint class we need to select the actor, and click this button on the details panel.

This will bring up the following dialog. We fill in the details as shown. One thing to be aware of is that as a kind of convention, blueprint classes are usually prefixed with **BP_** as we do here.

# Instantiating More #

As mentioned above, we can drag and drop the blueprint class from the content browser, or duplicate an existing blueprint class instance. Both instances will be linked to the same blueprint class asset, and if we change it then the instances will change (as we'll see soon!).

Make a second instance of the projectile in the scene alongside the first.

# Changing the Blueprint Class #

Let's modify the blueprint class to be more cannonball like. Firstly we'll need to enable physics, and secondly we'll want to change the material to something more like a cannonball.

Below shows the blueprint class editing windows and highlights the things we changed.

If we now go back to the scene again, notice that **both** instances have changed to the new material as expected.
