After we have run out of ammo, we want to be able to restart the level!

Unreal gives us the capability to do something after a certain length of time with the **Delay** node.

For us, we want to trigger a level reload after 5 seconds.

## Adding The Delay Node

We can go ahead and hook up a Delay node with 5 second duration to our "Out Of Ammo" printing node.

## Getting The Current Level Name

Unreal gives us a node to be able to get the name of the current level which is aptly named **Get Current Level Name** and can be hooked up as follows.

## Reloading The Level

We can pass the name we got for the current level above into the **Open Level (by Name)** node.

## Results

Finally we have finished the warehouse wreckage game! An example playthrough is as follows, and we can see the level reload occurring which resets all the elements.
