After covering the basics of taking references to actors in order to retrieve data from them, as in the last post that printed the mass, the next logical step is to be able to modify them. In particular, for warehouse wreckage which will be a physics sandbox type game, we need to be able to fire objects with an impulse.

# What is an Impulse? #

An impulse in physics is an instantaneous force relating to velocity change (which is an instantaneous amount), rather than acceleration which is a change over time.

The formula for force is $Force = Mass * Acceleration$ which is a change over time (due to acceleration being a change in velocity over time).

Whereas the formula for an impulse is $Impulse = Mass * Velocity Change$.

# Adding an Impulse #

For this little example, let's add an impulse to the cube that's spawned in the scene by using blueprints.

The graph is simple enough to show here, the new nodes are circled and explained below.

- **Space Bar** => This is an event node that triggers the Pressed pin when the space bar is pressed, and the Released pin when the space bar is released.
- **Add Impulse** => This node takes the Static Mesh Component to apply an impulse to. We can specify the impulse (in world space), which here we specify to be 70,000.

NOTE: If we wanted to ignore mass and do a direct velocity change regardless of mass, then we can check the **Vel Change** box.

# Results #

Running the scene, and then tapping space bar allows us to apply upwards impulses to the cube to hop it around a bit.
