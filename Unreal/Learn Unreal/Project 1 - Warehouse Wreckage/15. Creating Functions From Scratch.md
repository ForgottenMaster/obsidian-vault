In the [[14. Using Blueprint Functions|previous section]], we were able to refactor existing groups of nodes automatically into functions. However we can also create a function from scratch without having to have an example already hooked up.

## Creating The Function

In order to create a new function, we can simply click the "+" symbol under the "functions" section on the My Blueprint panel.

As an example, let's make one that takes two inputs, adds them together, and outputs the result - but which also prints the inputs and output when it's called.

This will also open up the graph for that function.

---
## Adding Inputs

Within a function graph, the entry point is the node that has the same name as the function (in this case Logged Add).

We can add additional inputs by using the "+" button of the "inputs" section on the function details panel.

Note that we can change the type of the input in the drop down. Here we selected Integer.

---
## Adding Outputs

In order to add outputs to the function we can do a similar thing by using the "+" symbol of the "Outputs" section of the details panel.

This creates a **new node** which is how we pass the variables to output back out of the function.

Here we want to pass back out an integer which will be the sum of the two input integers.

Now all we have to do is wire up between the two with the functionality we want.

## Implementing The Function

After implementing the simple test function node we'd end up with something like this.
