We are able to create functions on blueprints which can then be called from other event graphs!

In this case we'll take a look at making a launch function on our **BP_Projectile** class which can be invoked when spawned from the level's event graph.

---
## Create The Function

We'll go ahead and open the BP_Projectile class and click the **Full Blueprint Editor** option.

Once it's opened we'll create a new function called Launch (see [[15. Creating Functions From Scratch|this section]] for details on how to create a function). We'll copy the nodes across from the **Spawn Projectile** graph as a start.

---
## Fixing The Function

When we try to compile the graph, we hit an error!

The error message is telling us that we have an invalid target passed to the Get StaticMeshComponent node.

We can fix this by using the **Get Reference To Self** node as shown below.

## Hooking The Function Up

Finally we can go ahead and hook that up in the **Spawn Projectile** function by finding the node in the list.

Once we've dropped it in, we can pass along the spawned BP_Projectile instance as the target as such.
