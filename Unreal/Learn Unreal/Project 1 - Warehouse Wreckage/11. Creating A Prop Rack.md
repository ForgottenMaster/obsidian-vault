For our warehouse wreckage level, let's have a rack with shelves that we can place canisters and barrels and such on top of in order to knock them off.

After installing the props pack as explained [[9. Importing Assets|Here]] we have access to a rack, and shelves to put into it. However we need to compose these into a single unit ourselves which is what we do here.

## Placing The Rack

First thing to do is easy enough - drag and drop this into the scene!

## Adding Shelves

In order to add the shelves, we must drag and drop the **SM_Rack02** asset as a **child** of the **Static Mesh Component** on this rack.

We can then move the shelf up and down to the correct height.

This is how it looks after setting up the first shelf.

And after adding a second one we will get something like this.

## Enabling Physics

We now want to enable physics, but we should do so **only** on the root most actor. The sub meshes will follow the movement of the parent.
