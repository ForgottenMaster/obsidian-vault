Let's go ahead and factor out the check of whether we have ammo or not into its own function. We notice that it creates for us a function node that has **execution pins** as shown in the image below.

This is a bit strange because the function doesn't have any side-effects and is only working on some *pure* data. We therefore don't need execution pins.

Luckily Unreal has a way of letting us mark a function as pure which removes the execution pins. Simply select this option that we are presented with in the function details panel.

This will then go ahead and remove the execution pins for us, leaving us with a nice data-only accessor.
