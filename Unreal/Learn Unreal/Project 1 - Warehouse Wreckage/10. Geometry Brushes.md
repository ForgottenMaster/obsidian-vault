Unreal allows us to make basic geometry without resorting to an external modelling tool. We are able to place geometry down in one of two modes:

1. Additive => The geometry will represent a solid volume and mesh
2. Subtractive => The geometry will represent a void and will be taken away from any solid/additive geometry

## Opening the Panel

In order to access the geometry brushes, we need to open the **Place Actors** panel which we can easily open up through this option in the editor.

This will then open up the following panel down the side, as shown with the **Geometry** tab selected.

## Spawning An Additive Box

Additive brushes are the default so we can spawn one in our scene by dragging and dropping the Box brush into it.

We can modify the scaling of the box by using the brush properties.
**<div style="color:red;">Do not use the transform scaling</div>**
Below is showing the setup of our additive box, with a cube that is 3400x2700x760 units.

## Spawning A Subtractive Brush

Now that we have an outer shell mesh, we can carve out a play space inside of it to make a room of sorts.

To do this we can use another box brush but in subtractive mode to carve out a chunk from the inside of the box.

We'll go ahead and put a subtractive box in the same place but 200 units smaller on all the axes.

## Adding Windows

By adding in more subtractive boxes and scaling them correctly, we're able to punch multiple holes into the walls of the room and let some light in!.

This is what the scene looks like after adding some windows in.

## Setting Main As Start Scene

I've put the above geometry brushes into a new scene named **Main** however we need to set the project to have this scene as the actual starting scene.

To do this go to Settings -> Project Settings

![[Location Of Project Settings Window.png]]

In the resulting window, select the **Maps & Modes** category, and set the **Editor Startup Map** and **Game Default Map** to the new Main level as shown below.
