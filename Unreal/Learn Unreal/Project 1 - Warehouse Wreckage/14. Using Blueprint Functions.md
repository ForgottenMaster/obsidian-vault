Without tools to organise our event graphs, they can quickly get out of control with respect to complexity.

In code, we would factor out code snippets into functions. We can do the same in event graphs but factoring out groups of nodes into function nodes.

## Identifying A Function Node

We can identify a function node by the fact it has a little $f$ symbol on it. Unreal has many function nodes already built-in, for example:

But we can also create our own.

## Turning Existing Nodes Into Function

We can easily select a group of nodes in our graph and convert them into a function node. Simply select all the nodes that are to be converted and right-click to select the option.

We can then go ahead and rename the function to something more descriptive.

## More Functions

We can repeat this in order to get the other parts of the graph into functions as much as needed.

After a couple more functions have been made, we end up with a graph that looks something like this.
