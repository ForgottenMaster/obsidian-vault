We need to be able to spawn new instances of the blueprint class/prefab that we've created in the previous section in order to be able to have it act as a projectile for a physics based game. Luckily Unreal makes this easy enough to do.

# Adding a Spawner #

First of all we'll add a spawner to the level. This will be an invisible Actor which is only present to be able to get the transform from which to spawn the projectiles.

This can be added to the scene in the same way as we've added other actors in the past.

I'll rename this as **Spawner** in the outliner.

We can add a reference to this spawner into the level blueprint as we have previously with the cube actor.

# Spawning the Projectile #

The node we will be invoking when the space bar is pressed, in order to spawn a projectile instance is called **Spawn Actor From Class** as shown below, and can be hooked off the Pressed pin since we want to fire a projectile when the space bar is pressed.

We need to do a couple of things (circled in the image below):

1. We need to specify which blueprint class we're spawning, using the Class drop down.
2. We need to pass in a transform to spawn the instance at. We get this using the **Get Actor Transform** node on the spawner.

Additionally we then want to apply the upwards velocity change to the spawned instance. The full graph looks as follows

# Results #

Running the game we can see that as the projectile spawns in, it's given an upward velocity and then falls down due to gravity.
