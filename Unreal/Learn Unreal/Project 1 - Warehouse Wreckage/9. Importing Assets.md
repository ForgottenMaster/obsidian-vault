In order to be able to put together a more realistic scene with the feeling of destroying a warehouse with wrecking balls, we will need some assets that look like they could be from a warehouse.

In order to do this we'll be importing the **Industry Props Pack 6**

## Adding Pack to Library

The first thing we need to do is to navigate in the launcher to the Marketplace and then search for the pack we want by name

Go through the adding of the pack to the cart, and then checkout, following the standard procedures when purchasing things. 

This will add the pack to the Library.

## Importing Pack Into the Project

Navigate to the Library and then down to the vault section, then click **Add To Project** on the correct pack

This will bring up a dialog window where we can choose the project we would like to add the pack to (WarehouseWreckage), and click to import.

## Opening The Warehouse

This pack comes with a showcase scene which we will destroy using our cannonballs. We can go ahead and open it in the content drawer

By selecting various objects in the scene (barrels, etc.) and enabling physics - we can then fire the cannonball at them in order to knock them over.

The GIF below shows what we end up with after the above steps of modifying elements of the warehouse to be able to be knocked over.
