Now we want to add some of the barrels into the level in order to be able to knock them over.

## Creating A Barrel Blueprint

First of all we drag and drop one of the barrel assets from the asset pack into the level to instantiate one, then we want to convert it to a blueprint class so we can update in the future without changing every instance manually.

We can then fill out the dialog that pops up as follows.

## Setting Up Physics

Open up the **BP_Barrel** asset and enable physics simulation - also we'll increase the mass a bit for the physics simulation.

## Adding More Instances

Now we can go ahead and stack some barrels both on the shelf and off the shelf. We'll also put these into a folder for organisational purposes in the outliner.

However if you run the game, there's an issue with barrel physics!

## Fixing Barrel Physics

The issue here is that the physics collider mesh isn't set up correctly on the barrel asset in the prop pack.

If you enable the **Player Collision** view in the editor which is located here.

And zoom into one of the barrels, we can see the shape of the collision mesh which seems wonky.

We can fix this by replacing the collision mesh though. Firstly open up the barrel **StaticMeshComponent** asset by double-clicking on it. 

We can then remove the existing collision from the barrel from this menu at the top.

And we'll then use a more appropriate collision mesh for it which in this case will be the 10DOP-Z collision which is aligned with the z-axis (up).

When we now look at the barrel in the main viewport we can see it has a much better collision mesh now.

## Results

Finally we can see how it looks when we run the game. Notice the barrels stack nicely now until we hit them!
