The next thing to briefly look at is how to enable physics on the actors in the scene. This first project will be a physics-based game so we'll need to know how to set objects to participate in the physics simulation so we can knock them over.

# Setting Physics #

Toggling on physics is super simple (barely an inconvenience) in Unreal, we simply select an object we want to tweak - either by cicking on it in the scene viewport, or by clicking on it in the Outliner window.

Then in the Details window, we're able to filter for Physics options, and we'll find the **Simulate Physics** option that should be turned on.

There are also other settings there such as to enable gravity or not.

I'll turn physics simulation on for the table and the lamp.

# Spawning a Heavy Cube #

Next we can spawn in additional objects and shapes. As a test of the physics system, I'll spawn a new cube shape above the table and lamp.

We can spawn shapes quickly by using the **quickly add to project** option on the top toolbar.

Turning the physics simulation again on for that.

# Results #

Upon clicking play we can see the cube drop, and interact with the lamp and table to knock the lamp off the table
