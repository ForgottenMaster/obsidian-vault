Next, if the blueprint Event Graph is going to do anything useful, it will be necessary to be able to interact with objects in the scene. In order to do that we'll look at how to get a reference to an actor in the scene, along with how to get some information from it.

# Adding Actor Reference #

In order to add a reference to an actor in the scene into a blueprint event graph, just click the object in the scene to select it, and swap over to the event graph.

Right-click in the event graph and there will be an option to create a reference to the selected object. In this case for testing, select the cube we spawned, and we'll see the following

# Getting a Component #

Now we have an object in the event graph, we can get a component off it easily by dragging the output data pin to an empty spot in the graph which will pop up the node selection dialog.

Getting the component off an object involves just searching for a node of the form **Get (ComponentName)**.

In this case we'll get access to the **StaticMeshComponent**

# Accessing Data #

Now we have a component, we can use a getter node to access properties off that node, for example the **Get Mass** node which will give us the physics mass of the object in question.

We can then go ahead and print it out. Note that Unreal adds in a conversion node because Get Mass returns a floating point value, whereas Print String requires a string.

By playing the game we can see that indeed the mass of the cube is now printed out to the screen.
