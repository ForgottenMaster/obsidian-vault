We will want to get the location under the cursor in the world. We can do this by using the **APlayerController::GetHitResultUnderCursor** method.

# Implementing Tick Method

Firstly, we need to actually implement the Tick method in ATank.

We'll (re)move it from the ABasePawn class.

```cpp
void Tick(float DeltaTime) override;
```

For the implementation we will want to check that the player controller pointer is valid first. As a starting point, the function looks like this.

```cpp
void ATank::Tick(float DeltaTime)
{
	Super::Tick(DeltaTime);
	if (PlayerController != nullptr)
	{
		// Perform trace.
		// Draw debug sphere.
	}
}
```

# Getting Position Under Cursor

We first need to get the world space position under the mouse cursor. This method will do a trace on a given trace channel. We want to use the visibility trace channel so that anything that's blocking visibility will be hit.

```cpp
const bool bTraceComplex = false;
FHitResult HitResult;
if (PlayerController->GetHitResultUnderCursor(ECollisionChannel::ECC_Visibility, bTraceComplex, HitResult))
{
	// Draw debug sphere.
}
```

**bTraceComplex** is whether or not we're doing a complex trace. This is telling the method whether it's using simple collision or complex collision for the trace (how accurate the results are).

---
# Draw Debug Sphere

We need to go ahead and draw a debug sphere so we can verify that we have the correct location from the trace. First we need to include the file.

```cpp
#include "DrawDebugHelpers.h"
```

Then we can go ahead and call the function we want.

```cpp
const float Radius = 25.0f;
const int32 Segments = 25;
const FColor Color = FColor::Red;
DrawDebugSphere(GetWorld(), HitResult.ImpactPoint, Radius, Segments, Color);
```

---
# Testing

We can test to make sure the debug sphere is hitting at the correct location in the world now.
