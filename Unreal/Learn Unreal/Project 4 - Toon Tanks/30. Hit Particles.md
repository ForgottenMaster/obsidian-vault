As a summary, let's quickly recap what has already been covered:
- Created a tank that can move around a world with WASD
- Handle input from the player which includes the movement of the tank and mouse click to fire
- Enemy turrets that track the player when they're in range and periodically fire their missiles
- Added the firing functionality with the projectile framework provided by Unreal
- Added health, damage, and destruction into the game
- Added winning and losing conditions which are displayed with the HUD

# Particle Systems

The game is functional so we are into the polishing phase now and we firstly want some hit particles for when the missile explodes.

We need to use Unreal's particle system functionality to make these explosion effects.

In the project we can take a look at any particle system assets we might have, for example we have those for hit effect, smoke, etc.

Double-clicking on one (e.g. P_HitEffect) will open the particle system editor for us.

Here we'll be able to edit the particle system and in the top-left we can see a preview of the effect.

# Specifying Particle System To Spawn

Let's go ahead and spawn the particle system!

We want the explosion to happen on all projectiles, so we can simply edit the **UProjectile** class.

We simply need to go ahead and define a UPROPERTY of type **UParticleSystem** which should be exposed so we can link it in the editor.

```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category = "Combat")
class UParticleSystem* HitParticles;
```

We'll hop over to the **BP_Projectile** blueprint class and bind the **P_HitEffect** system to this property.

# Spawning Particle System

Now we just need to actually do the spawn. We can do this from code (in the OnHit) callback, by using **UGameplayStatics::SpawnEmitterAtLocation**

This should go juuuuuuust before the OnDestroy call.

```cpp
const FVector ProjectileLocation = GetActorLocation();
const FRotator ProjectileRotation = GetActorRotation();
UGameplayStatics::SpawnEmitterAtLocation(this, HitParticles, ProjectileLocation, ProjectileRotation);
```

# Testing

We'll give the game a quick test.
