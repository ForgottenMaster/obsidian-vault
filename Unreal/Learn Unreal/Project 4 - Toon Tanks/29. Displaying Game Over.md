Now we want to replace that print we have with an actual widget.

# Duplicating The WBP_StartGameWidget

Easy enough step!

We want most of the setup and functionality of the start game widget for our end game widget.

We can right-click to duplicate the blueprint, which we'll name **WBP_EndGameWidget**

# Removing Everything In Event Graph

Firstly we want to go ahead and remove everything that's in the event graph because we aren't displaying text in the same way!

Also remove the Countdown variable that is not needed.

What is left should be simply an empty event graph, and the exposed text widget.

# Spawning The Widget

In the Game Mode graph, we spawn the widget in response to the Game Over event being triggered.

Adding it to the viewport as we did with the [[25. Start Game Widget#Adding Widget|start game widget]].

The graph will look as follows.

Now we want to set the text on the widget to be something depending on the result of the Player Won flag passed in the game over event.

We can firstly get the text element from the widget by using the return value from the create widget node.

How do we pick the correct string to use?

We can use a **select** node!

This node takes two values of a given type and a boolean, and returns one or the other based on the boolean value.

In this case we want to select between a **You Win!** and a **You Lose!** text to display on the widget.

# Testing

Now we can test to make sure that the widget is showing correctly when we win or when we lose.

First testing the lose case:

And testing the win case:
