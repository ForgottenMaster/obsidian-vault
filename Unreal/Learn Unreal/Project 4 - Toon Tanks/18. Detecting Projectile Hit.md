We need to be able to detect **when** one of these projectiles hits something, so that we can cause it to explode, deal damage, etc.

For now we'll just make it log the collision information.

# Defining The OnHit Callback

We'll be registering a callback for when hits occur, but the callback function needs to be in a specific format.

Additionally it **MUST** be marked as a UFUNCTION or we'll get a runtime assert failure when it tries to bind the callback.

```cpp
UFUNCTION()
void OnHit(UPrimitiveComponent* HitComponent, AActor* OtherActor, UPrimitiveComponent* OtherComponent, FVector NormalImpulse, const FHitResult& HitResult);
```

An explanation of the parameters of the callback:

- **HitComponent** => Which component on **this** actor has collided.
- **OtherActor** => Which actor has this actor collided with.
- **OtherComponent** => Which component on that actor has this actor collided with.
- **NormalImpulse** => The impulse in the collision normal applied to resolve the collision (e.g. for bounce-back etc.).
- **HitResult** => The hit result structure containing info about the collision.

# Implementing The OnHit Callback

For implementing it, we'll simply have it log a bit of the information, enough to check that everything is working correctly.

```cpp
void AProjectile::OnHit(UPrimitiveComponent* HitComponent, AActor* OtherActor, UPrimitiveComponent* OtherComponent, FVector NormalImpulse, const FHitResult& HitResult)
{
	UE_LOGFMT(LogTemp, Log, "Component {0} hit component {1} on actor {2}, at position {3}", HitComponent->GetName(), OtherComponent->GetName(), OtherActor->GetActorNameOrLabel(), HitResult.Location.ToCompactString());
}
```

We also need to include the StructuredLog header to use UE_LOGFMT.

```cpp
#include "Logging/StructuredLog.h"
```

---
# Binding The Callback

For binding the callback, we need to use a macro available called **AddDynamic** which works with method syntax on a delegate.

In this case, UPrimitiveComponent provides an **OnComponentHit** delegate we can bind to.

We simply pass in the receiver object (this), and the address of the method to invoke.

```cpp
ProjectileMesh->OnComponentHit.AddDynamic(this, &AProjectile::OnHit);
```

This is done inside the **BeginPlay** method.

# Checking

Running the game and then checking the logs we can see that we're detecting the collisions as expected.
