This is a super easy step. We want to possess the tank pawn and be able to control it via our player controller when the game starts.

We can do this by setting the "Auto Possess Pawn" setting to "Player 0".

These players in the list aren't players including any from network replication, but simply different **local** player controllers.

Testing by running the game, we can see that indeed the camera we're using is the one of the possessed pawn.
