We want to make the tower shoot at the player every X seconds. To do this we can use a timer which is functionality provided by Unreal.

# Make The Fields

We want to go ahead and make ourselves a couple of fields on the ATower class.

```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category = "Combat")
float FireRate = 2.0f;

FTimerHandle FireTimerHandle;
```

The UPROPERTY **FireRate** will define the frequency (in seconds) of our timer. In our case we set it by default to shoot every 2 seconds, but because it's exposed as EditAnywhere, it can be changed in data if needed.

The **FireTimerHandle** field is of a type that uniquely identifies this timer amongst all timers that may have been started in the manager.

# Putting Range Check Into Helper

We will be checking in the timer if the tank is in range of the tower before firing. Since we already do a distance check for activating turret rotation, we don't want to repeat the logic twice - so we'll put it in a helper method.

```cpp
bool IsTankInFireRange() const;
```

This can be a const method since it's only querying and not modifying any data.

The definition will be as expected as well!

```cpp
bool ATower::IsTankInFireRange() const
{
	if (Tank == nullptr)
	{
		return false;
	}
	const FVector TankLocation = Tank->GetActorLocation();
	const FVector TowerLocation = GetActorLocation();
	const float Distance = FVector::Dist(TankLocation, TowerLocation);
	return Distance <= FireRange;
}
```

If the Tank doesn't exist (nullptr), we can just say it can't be in range. Else we get the positions and check distance as before.

We can then update the Tick method to use that as follows.

```cpp
if (IsTankInFireRange())
{
	RotateTurret(Tank->GetActorLocation());
}
```

# Defining The Callback Method

Next we need to go ahead and create the method that will be called back by the timer manager.

All this needs to do is check the range of the tank, and if in range, trigger the Fire method.

Declaration in the header is as follows.

```cpp
void PerformFireActionIfAppropriate();
```

In the definition, it's straightforward and as expected.

```cpp
void ATower::PerformFireActionIfAppropriate()
{
	if (IsTankInFireRange())
	{
		Fire();
	}
}
```

---
# Setting The Timer

Finally inside the BeginPlay method we can go ahead and set the timer. Firstly there's a header file that needs including.

```cpp
#include "TimerManager.h"
```

Next we can call the **SetTimer** method. 

```cpp
const bool bLoop = true;
GetWorldTimerManager().SetTimer(FireTimerHandle, this, &ATower::PerformFireActionIfAppropriate, FireRate, bLoop);
```

Here we pass the handle we're using to identify this timer instance, along with the receiving object (this), and the address of the method to call back. We then pass the FireRate through, and tell it we want to loop.

# Testing

If we look in the editor now, we'll see that the debug spheres are drawn at the tower's projectile spawn location every 2 seconds if the player is in range.
