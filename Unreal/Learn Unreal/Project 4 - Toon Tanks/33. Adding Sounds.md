Let's go ahead and add some sounds to go with particles. The sounds we'll have are:

- Projectile Fired/Spawned
- Projectile Hit
- Death/Explosion

# Adding Properties

We'll need to add properties to be able to bind the sounds. The type used in Unreal will be **USoundBase**.

We will need a launch and hit effect on the projectile itself, and then we'll put a death sound on the **BP_BasePawn** as well.

In the projectile we have:

```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category = "Combat")
USoundBase* LaunchSound;

UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category = "Combat")
USoundBase* HitSound;
```

And in the BP_BasePawn we have:

```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category = "Combat")
USoundBase* DeathSound;
```

# Playing Sounds

To play the sounds we can use the **PlaySoundAtLocation** static function of **UGameplayStatics**.

In the projectile we can do this to play the launch sound in **BeginPlay** (when the projectile is spawned).

```cpp
	if (LaunchSound != nullptr)
	{
		UGameplayStatics::PlaySoundAtLocation(this, LaunchSound, GetActorLocation());
	}
```

And in the OnHit event. Put it inside the check for what it's hitting. That portion should look like this.

```cpp
if (OtherActor != nullptr && OtherActor != this && OtherActor != ProjectileOwner)
{
	UGameplayStatics::ApplyDamage(OtherActor, DamageAmount, EventInstigator, this, DamageTypeClass);
	const FVector ProjectileLocation = GetActorLocation();
	const FRotator ProjectileRotation = GetActorRotation();
	UGameplayStatics::SpawnEmitterAtLocation(this, HitParticles, ProjectileLocation, ProjectileRotation);
	Destroy();
	if (HitSound != nullptr)
	{
		UGameplayStatics::PlaySoundAtLocation(this, HitSound, GetActorLocation());
	}
}
```

Then over in **BP_BasePawn** we can add the following to the **HandleDestruction**

```cpp
if (DeathSound != nullptr)
{
	UGameplayStatics::PlaySoundAtLocation(this, DeathSound, GetActorLocation());
}
```

# Binding Sounds

Now we will want to bind the sounds in **BP_Projectile** and then **BP_PawnTurret** and **BP_PawnTank** as well.

In **BP_Projectile** we can set the launch and hit sounds to be the same, but they have the flexibility to be different.

In both the turret and the tank blueprints we can bind the death effect to be an explosion.

# Testing

Just play in editor and fire some projectiles, blow things up. They should make the sounds now!
