This will be the final section of **code** that we need to implement for Toon Tanks and everything else will be in editor only.

The feature in question is the ability to tell blueprint when the game is over, and whether the player won or lost.

---
# Create The Event

Since this is once again a function we want to call from code but which will be implemented in blueprint, we want to use the BlueprintImplementableEvent specifier again as such.

```cpp
UFUNCTION(BlueprintImplementableEvent)
void GameOver(bool bPlayerWon);
```

# Tracking Towers

We need to count the number of towers that are in the game. Every time one dies we can decrement the count.

If the count reaches 0 then the player wins.

Let's add a variable to the GameMode class.

```cpp
size_t NumberOfTowers;
```

In the BeginPlay implementation, we want to get the number of actors of our tower class that exist in the world.

There is a method that takes a class descriptor, and an array and fills the array out with all matching actors. We then simply need to get the number of returned actors.

```cpp
TArray<AActor*> Actors{};
UGameplayStatics::GetAllActorsOfClass(this, ATower::StaticClass(), Actors);
NumberOfTowers = Actors.Num();
```

We create an empty array for the actors, ask for all the actors of the ATower class (see **ATower::StaticClass()**). We don't need the actors themselves, only the number of them which we then assign.

---
# Calling GameOver

The logic for calling GameOver will be evaluated when an actor dies.

In the case that the player dies, that's easy! The game is lost.

```cpp
if (DeadActor == Tank)
{
	Tank->HandleDestruction();
	if (Controller != nullptr)
	{
		Controller->SetPlayerEnabledState(false);
	}
	GameOver(false);
}
```

In the case that a turret/tower dies, we need to decrement the count of remaining towers, and then we need to check against 0.

```cpp
else if (ATower* const DestroyedTower = Cast<ATower>(DeadActor))
{
	DestroyedTower->HandleDestruction();
	if (--NumberOfTowers == 0)
	{
		GameOver(true);
	}
}
```

# Hooking Up In Blueprints

Now we can go to our game mode blueprint and implement the event we added.

For testing purposes for now, just hook up to a print. But this will get changed later to a proper HUD etc.

Now when we run the game we can test that the print is correct when we lose the game by being destroyed:

Or when we destroy all the turrets:
