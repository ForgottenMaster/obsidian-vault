We currently have the tank and tower inheriting from ABasePawn, but we would like additional components and functionality will be different depending on whether it's a tank or a tower in the game.

So let's start by making the BP_Tank class inherit instead from a new actor class called ATank and adding a camera to follow the tank.

---
# Creating ATank
First of all is creating the actual subclass, which we can do with the following option on right-click of the base pawn script.

![[Creating A Derived C++ Class.png]]

We'll call it Tank so the resulting type in code is ATank.

# Making BP_PawnTank Derive From ATank

Next if we open up BP_PawnTank, and select Class Settings, we can choose a new parent class for this class. Let's choose our Tank class as the parent.

# Adding The New Components

For our Tank, we need a camera that can follow the tank pawn. We'll attach this to the end of a spring arm component which tries to keep the camera at a given distance, but has additional functionalities.

In the code, we can add the following to the header to declare that we would like to create these new components.

```cpp
private:
	UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere, Category = "Components")
	class USpringArmComponent* SpringArm;

	UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere, Category = "Components")
	class UCameraComponent* Camera;
```

And then in the constructor for ATank, we can go ahead and construct them, and set them up.

```cpp
	SpringArm = CreateDefaultSubobject<USpringArmComponent>(TEXT("Spring Arm"));
	SpringArm->SetupAttachment(RootComponent);

	Camera = CreateDefaultSubobject<UCameraComponent>(TEXT("Camera"));
	Camera->SetupAttachment(SpringArm);
```

Also don't forget the necessary includes!

```cpp
#include "GameFramework/SpringArmComponent.h"
#include "Camera/CameraComponent.h"
```

# Checking

When we open BP_PawnTank now in the editor we should now see the spring arm and camera underneath.

Let's quickly go ahead and rotate the spring arm so we're looking at the tank from a 45 degree angle.
