We want to be able to fire projectiles at the enemy if we're the player, or at the player if we're the enemy.

Since this functionality is desired for both, we'll make a function on BasePawn.

---
# Fire Method

We'll make the method on BasePawn, but it doesn't need any parameters. Here's the declaration.

```cpp
void Fire();
```

And for the definition, we have the following.

```cpp
void ABasePawn::Fire()
{
	const FVector ProjectileSpawnPointLocation = ProjectileSpawnPoint->GetComponentLocation();
	const UWorld* const World = GetWorld();
	const float Radius = 25.0f;
	const int32 Segments = 12;
	const FColor Color = FColor::Red;
	const bool bPersistentLines = false;
	const float LifeTime = 3.0f;
	DrawDebugSphere(World, ProjectileSpawnPointLocation, Radius, Segments, Color, bPersistentLines, LifeTime);
}
```

This method gets the location of the projectile spawn point and (for now) renders a debug sphere at that location that persists for 3 seconds.

---
# Binding To Input Action

Next, for the player tank we want to have this method called whenever the Fire action mapping occurs.

This action mapping is set to trigger when the left mouse button is pressed.

We need to add the following line in for that into the ATank::**SetupPlayerInputComponent** method.

```cpp
PlayerInputComponent->BindAction("Fire", EInputEvent::IE_Pressed, this, &ATank::Fire);
```

This takes an additional parameter which indicates the event type that occurs for the callback to be called.

In this case, it occurs if we *press* the fire action/button.

---
# Testing

To test, we can rotate the turret while clicking the mouse button. This allows us to trigger the Fire function and the debug spheres show that it is working correctly.
