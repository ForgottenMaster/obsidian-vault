Note that we have a countdown timer of 3 seconds from starting the game to the player being able to move, so we want to have a 3 second countdown also on the UI/widget side of things.

We could connect the two and have the code tell the UI when the 1 second ticks occur, but in this case we'll just go ahead and put it together ourselves.

# Adding A Variable

Firstly need to add a variable to the widget to hold the remaining time.

Open up the widget blueprint we made in the [[25. Start Game Widget|previous section]] and click the Graph tab in the top right hand corner to get to the event graph for the widget.

Create a float variable with the default value of 3 as we have done several times in blueprints.

# On Tick Decrement By Delta Time

We can now go ahead and decrement the remaining time by the delta time that we're provided with in the tick event.

This will ensure that each frame we reduce the countdown timer by an appropriate amount.

# Displaying Message

For now, we'll only use the countdown timer to display an appropriate message for each second.

We'll first go ahead and **Ceil** the remaining amount before using it for display logic. This ensures that, for example when the remaining time is actually 1.7 seconds, it shows as 2 seconds, and only reduces to 1 second if we have 1 or less left.

After ceiling the value, we'll use the **Switch on Int** node to print an appropriate message.

![[Ceil And Switch On Int.png]]

The way that the switch on int node works, is that we need to add pins with specific integer values using the **Add pin** option.

Let's add pins for:
- **3** => "Get Ready!"
- **2** => "2"
- **1** => "1"
- **0** => "Go!"
- **Default** => "Start Game"

After hooking up these prints we get the following.

# Testing

Test that this works as intended by running the game and should see appropriate messages spammed each frame but for the second we're in.
