Next we'll go ahead and create a custom Game Mode which allows us to put logic for winning and losing in code (after health depleted for example).

Firstly create a new game mode that derives from **AGameModeBase**.

Unreal gives us the ability to derive our game mode either from **AGameModeBase** or **AGameMode**. AGameMode provides extra functionality to hold state, and for multiplayer games but we don't need that, so AGameModeBase is fine.

# Deriving Blueprint Child Class

Once we have the code class representing the game mode, we can go ahead and create a child blueprint with the right-click menu as we've done before.

Call it **BP_ToonTanksGameMode**.

---
# Setting Game Mode

Now that we have the blueprint for our game mode, we need to tell the project to use that game mode.

Can be set in the project settings here.

# Setting Default Pawn

Next we need to tell the game mode that we want to spawn the tank pawn and have the player possess it at startup.

Can do this by opening up BP_ToonTanksGameMode and setting the field specifying the default pawn to spawn.

# Removing Manually Placed Tank

The game mode will automatically spawn the pawn and have the player controller possess it when we start running the game.

We should remove the tank that we had manually placed in the level though.

This will then spawn the player tank at the player start location.
