To be able to control the tank with user input, we want to bind our input mappings to the various handling functions.

# Taking A Look At Axis Mappings

First let's take a look at the mappings we have set up.

This can be seen in **Edit => Project Settings => Input**

![[Axis Mappings.png]]

Can see here that there are a few set up, but for the time being we only care about the MoveForward mapping.

This is a (1D) Axis Mapping meaning that it returns a floating point value along a number line.

In this case, we say that the W key has a scale of 1.0 so when it's on (1) it'll be 1.0, and when it's off (0) it'll be 0.0.

The S key has a scale of -1.0 which means when it's on (1) it'll be -1.0, and when it's off (0) it'll be 0.0.

Unreal will combine these two values together by adding them to yield the final value.

# Move SetupPlayerInputComponent

At the moment only the parent class (ABasePawn) has this SetupPlayerInputComponent method defined.

However, we **don't** need player input on the base pawn, but we **do** need it on the tank which is to be controlled by the player.

We'll move the definition to the header file of ATank.

```cpp
void SetupPlayerInputComponent(class UInputComponent* PlayerInputComponent) override;
```

In the cpp file, we have the following for now.

```cpp
void ATank::SetupPlayerInputComponent(class UInputComponent* PlayerInputComponent)
{
	Super::SetupPlayerInputComponent(PlayerInputComponent);
}
```

---
# Create Move Callback

We need to define a callback function to be able to bind it to an axis mapping. We will call it **Move** and it needs to take a float value to be able to be bound to an axis mapping.

```cpp
void Move(float Value);
```

It'll be left empty for now

```cpp
void ATank::Move(float Value)
{
}
```

---
# Binding Move Callback

Inside the SetupPlayerInputComponent method we can now go ahead and bind it to the appropriate axis mapping (named MoveForward).

```cpp
PlayerInputComponent->BindAxis("MoveForward", this, &ATank::Move);
```

This bind method takes the axis mapping name, the receiver (what'll be set implicitly as the *this* parameter), and the address of the method to call.

---
# Implementing Move

We now want to go ahead and implement the guts of the tank movement. This should be fairly simple. We want to move **forward** (X axis) along the tank's **local** axes by either positive or negative some amount of speed.

First we need to add a Speed property. This can be EditAnywhere so that we can alter it if needed in the blueprints/instances.

```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category = "Components")
double Speed = 100.0;
```

We can do this with the following code.

```cpp
const FVector Velocity = FVector(Speed, 0.0, 0.0);
const double DeltaTime = UGameplayStatics::GetWorldDeltaSeconds(this);
AddActorLocalOffset(Velocity * DeltaTime * Value);
```

Note that the way we must get the delta seconds is through UGameplayStatics, since we're not inside the Tick function (which gets it passed along). We need to pass any UObject in the world we care about so the function can get the correct delta time from the correct world. We therefore pass along our own object pointer.

In order to access the UGameplayStatics type, we will need to go ahead and include.

```cpp
#include "Kismet/GameplayStatics.h"
```

Test it to make sure it's working as well.
