We can go ahead and create a class now representing the projectile itself. This is only required to be a basic Actor class as we don't need input etc.

---
# Creating The Class

Won't bother showing the actual class creation here - suffice it to say, we want to make a class called **AProjectile** and have it inherit from **AActor** as a parent, since we don't need the other functionality that comes with pawns or characters.

We then need to add a **UStaticMeshComponent** pointer which will be the static mesh component for the projectile.

```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category = "Components")
UStaticMeshComponent* ProjectileMesh;
```

---
# Disabling Tick Functionality

The actor itself won't do ticking, but instead we'll be using a movement component to handle the movement for us.

Therefore in the actor itself, we can remove the Tick method override, and set in the constructor.

```cpp
PrimaryActorTick.bCanEverTick = false;
```

---
# Creating The Static Mesh Component

We can now go ahead and create ourselves the mesh component in the constructor and set it as our root component.

```cpp
ProjectileMesh = CreateDefaultSubobject<UStaticMeshComponent>(TEXT("Projectile Mesh"));
RootComponent = ProjectileMesh;
```

---
# Creating The Blueprint Class

Finally we'll make the blueprint version of the class. As usual we can right-click the C++ class to make a new blueprint subclass that we'll call **BP_Projectile**.

We just need to set the static mesh for this in the blueprint.
