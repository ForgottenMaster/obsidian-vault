Now that we've spawned the projectiles, we need them to move. There are a few ways we *could* do this:

- Implementing the Tick method directly on AProjectile, and having it move the projectile.
- Setting an impulse or forces and having it moved by the physics system.
- Using Unreal's built-in helper component **ProjectileMovementComponent** which will control movement of another SceneComponent

Since the last one is built-in and designed for projectiles, we'll just use that for moving the projectiles.

# Adding The Movement Component

In the AProjectile class, we'll go ahead and add a UPROPERTY that references the ProjectileMovementComponent we'll make.

```cpp
UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere, Category = "Combat")
class UProjectileMovementComponent* ProjectileMovementComponent;
```

In the .cpp file, we need to include the appropriate header to access the UProjectileMovementComponent type in its entirety.

```cpp
#include "GameFramework/ProjectileMovementComponent.h"
```

In the constructor for AProjectile we can then go ahead and spawn (and attach) a movement component to the actor. We'll also set up initial and max speeds.

```cpp
ProjectileMovementComponent = CreateDefaultSubobject<UProjectileMovementComponent>(TEXT("Projectile Movement Component"));
ProjectileMovementComponent->InitialSpeed = 1000.0f;
ProjectileMovementComponent->MaxSpeed = 2000.0f;
```

These speeds can be tweaked in blueprints if needed as well!

# Testing

We can go ahead and test, and we see that the spawned projectiles are moving until either they hit something or seemingly when they travel a certain distance as well.
