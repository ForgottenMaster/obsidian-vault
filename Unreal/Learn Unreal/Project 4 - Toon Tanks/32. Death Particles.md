Similarly to how we have [[30. Hit Particles|hit particles]] we want to also have a particle that will be spawned when a tower or tank dies.

This will be fairly straightforward and follow the same process as in the hit particles.

# Add A Property

Firstly add a new property that's editable in the details panel, of type UParticleSystem*. This will go in **BasePawn** because we want it to be spawned for both types of pawn.

Code should be as follows in the ABasePawn class.

```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category = "Combat")
UParticleSystem* DeathParticles;
```

---
# Spawning

Next we want to spawn the system when we are destroyed. Firstly include the appropriate header.

```cpp
#include "Particles/ParticleSystem.h"
```

Next in the **HandleDestruction** method, we'll go ahead and spawn the particles.

The method should look as follows.

```cpp
void ABasePawn::HandleDestruction()
{
	if (DeathParticles != nullptr)
	{
		UGameplayStatics::SpawnEmitterAtLocation(this, DeathParticles, GetActorLocation(), GetActorRotation());
	}
}
```

# Blueprint Setup

We now just have to fill this out in **BP_PawnTank** and **BP_PawnTurret** and just set them to **P_DeathEffect**

# Testing

If all is well then when a turret or the tank dies we should see a little explosion effect.
