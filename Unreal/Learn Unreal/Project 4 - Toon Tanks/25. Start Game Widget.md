We [[24. Starting The Game#Adding A Timer To Enable|currently]] have a timer running when the program starts, after which the game actually starts and input taken from the player.

However we currently aren't showing anything to say that the game is starting soon.

In this section, we'll implement a widget to be shown that tells the player the game will be starting soon.

# Adding a Blueprint Implementable Event

First thing we want to do is to have an event that we can hook into in Blueprints. We'll use this to show the widget when the game actually starts.

Since the game starting is controlled from C++ side of things, but we want to react in Blueprints, we want a way to expose a function call as an event we can implement on the Blueprint side.

We can do this by using the UFUNCTION macro as before, but with the **BlueprintImplementableEvent** specifier.

In our game mode class, we want to put the following in the header

```cpp
protected:
	UFUNCTION(BlueprintImplementableEvent)
	void StartGame();
```

**NOTE:** Unreal doesn't expect this to have an actual implementation/body in C++ because it's intended to be implemented in Blueprint. We can call it however from C++.

---
# Calling StartGame

We want to go ahead and call this StartGame function from inside our **HandleGameStart** method so that whatever is provided on the Blueprint side as an implementation can be invoked.

This is simply a case of putting the following in HandleGameStart

```cpp
StartGame();
```

---
# Implementing Start Game

Now that we're calling the event on the C++ side, we want to go ahead and implement it on the Blueprint side.

Going into the **BP_ToonTanksGameMode** event graph, we can search for this event, and add it to the graph as a new node.

# Creating The Start Game Widget

Now we have a way to react to the game being started, we need a UI widget that we'll display to the player when we get this event being triggered by C++.

In the right-click context menu to create a new asset, we're able to find **Widget Blueprint** which should be used.

![[Creating A Widget Blueprint.png]]

We just want basic widget functionality so in the wizard that appears we'll pick just the **User Widget** option. We'll go ahead and name this **WBP_StartGameWidget**.

---
# Editing The Widget

Double-clicking on the newly created widget blueprint will present us with the widget blueprint editor.

# Adding Canvas Panel

The first widget element we want to add to the hierarchy for this widget will be a canvas that represents our entire screen.

The canvas bounds will be stretched across the viewport, therefore we can position elements within the viewport by ensuring they're positioned correctly within this canvas panel.

Just drag and drop into the hierarchy.

---
# Adding Text

Next we want to go ahead and add some text to the canvas panel that will be displayed on the screen.

---
# Setting The Anchor

Notice that when we click on the text element in the hierarchy we can see a kind of "fan" widget where the anchor currently is within the parent.

![[Noticing The Anchor.png]]

Notice that currently the top left of the widget is anchored to the top left of the parent.

We want to make it centered though, so need to change the anchor to the center. Can do this by changing it in the details panel for the element.

![[Changing The Anchor.png]]

---
# Setting The Alignment

Next we want to align the text element around that anchor. Let's centralise that as well.

This is done by setting the alignment to 0.5,0.5 which is 50%,50% of the element size.

![[Setting Alignment.png]]

---
# Setting The Position

Now we can go ahead and set the position of the center of the text element **relative to the parent anchor**.

For the x coordinate, we just want that positioned perfectly central on the x axis, so it's set to 0.

For the y coordinate, picking something that puts the text about 1/4 of the way down the viewport should work.

![[Setting Position.png]]

---
# Changing Text

Clicking on the element and checking the details panel will allow us to set the text we want to display. In our case it'll be something like **Get Ready!**.

![[Setting Text.png]]

---
# Resizing Bounds

Notice that the text is overlapping the green bounds of the element. We can go ahead and resize these bounds to encompass the text entirely (using the little dot handles).

Can also use the Size fields.

![[Setting Size.png]]

---
# Adding Widget

Now we have the widget, we need to add it to the viewport at runtime. We'll go ahead and spawn and add it in response to the **Start Game** event we made earlier.

To spawn a widget, use the **Create Widget** node and select the blueprint to instantiate (in this case **WBP_StartGameWidget**).

It'll need adding to the viewport as well with the Add Viewport node.
