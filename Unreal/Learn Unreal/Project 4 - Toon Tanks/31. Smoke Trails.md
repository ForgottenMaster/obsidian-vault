We [[30. Hit Particles|previously]] added hit effects for the missiles when they hit something, but we want them to have a cool smoke trail as they're moving around.

Whereas previously with the fire and forget, one shot particles we just spawn the particle system at a fixed location and rotation and it cleans up after doing its thing, we want the smoke emitter to follow the actor.

In order to do this we want a particle system **component** and add that to the actor.

# Creating The Component

We first want to go ahead and create and add a particle system component to the projectile when it's spawned.

We can do this from code, however we will need to fill some things out in the editor so we will need a UPROPERTY for the component which is **visible** anywhere (blueprints).

In the Projectile class then we can do the following.

```cpp
UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere, Category = "Combat")
class UParticleSystemComponent* SmokeTrailComponent;
```

Then when we spawn/construct the projectile we can do the following.

```cpp
SmokeTrailComponent = CreateDefaultSubobject<UParticleSystemComponent>(TEXT("Smoke Trail"));
SmokeTrailComponent->SetupAttachment(RootComponent);
```

# Binding Template

Now if we go to the **BP_Projectile** blueprint class we can go ahead and bind the particle system template we will want to follow the actor around.

In this case we need **P_ProjectileTrail** as shown here.

# Testing

Finally going into game we'll be able to tell if it's working or not. Should look something like this.
