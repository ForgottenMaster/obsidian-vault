Now that we have the countdown logic for the widget, instead of printing the text we'll want to change the text on the start game widget so that it displays the countdown.

# Exposing Element As Variable

First of all, let's change the name of the Text element in the start game widget to something more readable.

Additionally we need to check the **Is Variable** checkbox which is off by default.

# Setting Text

Now we go to the event graph and we can access the DisplayText element as a variable.

We'll use the **SetText** node to set the text of this variable correctly.

For the default case when the count drops below 0, we can go ahead and just remove this widget from the parent widget which will clean it up.

# Setting Justification Of Text

Currently the text is **left justified** meaning that when we count down, the text isn't staying in the same position.

We should go to the element and set it to be centered.

# Setting Shadow On Text

Finally as a nicety, we'll add a shadow to the text. This is easy to do as well from the details panel, just pick a color for the drop shadow.

# Testing

Now that everything is set up correctly, we should be able to see the countdown on the screen until the game starts.
