Here is the overview of the way that we will handle damage application.

![[Overview.png]]

Routing the actor death through the game mode will ultimately allow it to decide if the game is over as well.

# Create HandleDestruction In ABasePawn

The base pawn destruction will contain any common functionality for both the tank and the turret/tower.

For now just define the header (in public section).

```cpp
void HandleDestruction();
```

And empty body (for now) in the cpp file.

```cpp
void ABasePawn::HandleDestruction()
{
	// TODO: Visual/sound effects
}
```

Note that this doesn't need to actually be a virtual function!

We will call the base one explicitly through HandleDestruction on the tank and turret, and the game mode will call through pointers of those types specifically.

---
# Create HandleDestruction in ATower

The header will define a HandleDestruction method that looks the same as the base pawn one (though has no link between the two due to not being marked as virtual).

```cpp
void HandleDestruction();
```

In the body, we want to:
1. Call ABasePawn::HandleDestruction.
2. Destroy the tower itself.

This looks like follows.

```cpp
void ATower::HandleDestruction()
{
	Super::HandleDestruction();
	Destroy();
}
```

---
# Create HandleDestruction in ATank

For ATank's version, the header will look the same as the other two.

For implementation, we want to:
1. Call ABasePawn::HandleDestruction.
2. Set the tank to be invisible.
3. Disable the update/tick of the tank actor.

Coding that up, we get the following.

```cpp
void ATank::HandleDestruction()
{
	Super::HandleDestruction();
	SetActorHiddenInGame(true);
	SetActorTickEnabled(false);
}
```

---
# Caching Player Tank In Game Mode

Next we want to go ahead and look up the player tank pawn in BeginPlay. When an actor is destroyed, we'll check it against the player tank.

Firstly make a variable for this in the AToonTanksGameMode class (can be private).

```cpp
private:
	class ATank* Tank;
```

Next we need to override the BeginPlay method so we can cache the player's tank.

```cpp
protected:
	void BeginPlay() override;
```

We can get the player pawn with the **UGameplayStatics::GetPlayerPawn** static function.

We need to cast the returned pointer however, because GetPlayerPawn  returns a pointer of type **APawn** and we want **ATank**.

The implemented method therefore looks as follows.

```cpp
void AToonTanksGameMode::BeginPlay()
{
	Super::BeginPlay();
	Tank = Cast<ATank>(UGameplayStatics::GetPlayerPawn(this, 0));
}
```

The **this** argument is a UObject that will act as a context for accessing the Unreal world. And we can give it the player index of 0, because we know there's only one player.

---
# Add Getter To ATank For Player Controller

Next we want to go ahead and add a getter method to the tank to allow access to the player controller. We'll just inline this into the header.

```cpp
APlayerController* GetPlayerController() const { return PlayerController; }
```

---
# Implementing ActorDied

Next we need to provide a method on the game mode that we can call, and will check the dead actor before dispatching to the correct HandleDestruction method.

The signature will show that it takes an AActor to check and act on.

```cpp
public:
	void ActorDied(AActor* DeadActor);
```

In the implementation, first check if the dead actor is in fact the player tank.

```cpp
if (DeadActor == Tank)
{
	// TODO
}
```

If it's the player tank, then we will go ahead and firstly call the HandleDestruction method residing on the ATank actor.

```cpp
Tank->HandleDestruction();
```

We then want to try to get the player controller from the tank, and if it's not null, we'll be going ahead and preventing future input.

```cpp
APlayerController* const PlayerController = Tank->GetPlayerController();
if (PlayerController != nullptr)
{
	// TODO
}
```

The disabling of the input will be:
1. Disabling the input
2. Hiding the mouse cursor

Which looks as follows.

```cpp
Tank->DisableInput(PlayerController);
PlayerController->bShowMouseCursor = false;
```

If the dead actor is not the tank, then we need to cast to a tower and call the HandleDestruction through that casted pointer.

```cpp
else if (ATower* const DestroyedTower = Cast<ATower>(DeadActor))
{
	DestroyedTower->HandleDestruction();
}
```

For completion, the entire function looks as follows.

```cpp
if (DeadActor == Tank)
{
	Tank->HandleDestruction();
	APlayerController* const PlayerController = Tank->GetPlayerController();
	if (PlayerController != nullptr)
	{
		Tank->DisableInput(PlayerController);
		PlayerController->bShowMouseCursor = false;
	}
}
else if (ATower* const DestroyedTower = Cast<ATower>(DeadActor))
{
	DestroyedTower->HandleDestruction();
}
```

---
# Calling ActorDied

Finally we can call the ActorDied method on the game mode when an actor drops to 0 health.

In HealthComponent, we'll need to get and store a pointer to the game mode so we can later call ActorDied on it. We'll do this in BeginPlay.

First define a variable to hold the game mode pointer.

```cpp
class AToonTanksGameMode* GameMode;
```

In the BeginPlay method of the HealthComponent, we can then look up the game mode from **UGameplayStatics::GetGameMode**.

However as we did with the player pawn, we need to cast as this returns a pointer of the base game mode type.

```cpp
GameMode = Cast<AToonTanksGameMode>(UGameplayStatics::GetGameMode(this));
```

Finally in the DamageTaken method of HealthComponent, check the health and if it's 0 (or less) then the actor is dead and we can call the method.

```cpp
if (Health <= 0.0f)
{
	GameMode->ActorDied(DamagedActor);
}
```
