Now we have the player tank that can be [[6. Binding Movement To Input|moved]], [[8. Making Tank Rotate|rotated]], and [[11. Rotating The Turret|aims at the cursor location]], we can go ahead and implement the aiming functionality on the enemy turret as well.

---
# Derive The Tower Class

Firstly we'll go ahead and derive the tower class from our C++ BasePawn class, and reparent BP_PawnTurret to it.

We covered this when [[4. Making A Tank Actor Class|making the tank]] so the process is much the same, but showing this for completeness.

# Move RotateTurret

We will need to be able to access the RotateTurret method to be able to rotate the enemy turrets to face the player tank.

This is just a copy-paste from Tank's .h/.cpp file into the BasePawn's .h/.cpp file so no need to show that here.

---
# Make ATank Field

We can go ahead and define a field to store off the player's tank pointer when we get access to it.

```cpp
private:
	class ATank* Tank;
```

---
# Implement BeginPlay

We need to implement the BeginPlay method for our ATower class. In the header this is somewhat familiar.

```cpp
protected:
	void BeginPlay() override;
```

In the .cpp file, we'll implement a look up to get the player pawn.

```cpp
void ATower::BeginPlay() 
{
	Super::BeginPlay();
	Tank = Cast<ATank>(UGameplayStatics::GetPlayerPawn(this, 0));
}
```

This uses a static function called **GetPlayerPawn**. This takes 2 parameters.

1. A UObject from which to get the UWorld we're operating within.
2. An index of a player to get the pawn for.

However this is returned as a pointer of APawn type which is why we then need to cast it to an ATank type.

---
# Adding A FireRange Variable

Let's add a variable that can be edited in the editor to dictate how close the player tank should be before the enemy turrets aim and fire at them.

```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category = "Combat")
float FireRange = 700.0f;
```

---
# Implementing The Tick Method

Next we can implement the Tick method. The declaration is familiar.

```cpp
void Tick(float DeltaTime) override;
```

This is the implementation, will explain it briefly afterwards.

```cpp
void ATower::Tick(float DeltaTime)
{
	Super::Tick(DeltaTime);
	if (Tank != nullptr)
	{
		const FVector TankLocation = Tank->GetActorLocation();
		const FVector TowerLocation = GetActorLocation();
		const float Distance = FVector::Dist(TankLocation, TowerLocation);
		if (Distance <= FireRange)
		{
			RotateTurret(TankLocation);
		}
	}
}
```

Firstly need to check if the Tank pointer is not null before using it (though shouldn't be, but might have been destroyed).

We then get our (the turret's) location, and the tank's location before calculating the distance between them.

If the distance is within the fire range then go ahead and rotate the turret to aim at that location.
