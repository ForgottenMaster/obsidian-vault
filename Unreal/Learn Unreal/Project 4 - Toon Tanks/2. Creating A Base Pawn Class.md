In toon tanks, there are two kinds of tanks that can move around the level and shoot. These are the **player** and **enemy** tanks.

Since they have the same basic functionality but differ in how they're controlled (either by AI or player input), we should have a base class to implement the common functionality.

## Actor Types

In Unreal, there are three kinds of actor which have varying degrees of functionality.

1. Actor => This is a basic kind of actor that can be placed in the world, and has the ability to have components attached to it including visuals, etc.
2. Pawn => This is an Actor that additionally has the ability to be possessed by a controller and can receive and react to user input (e.g. to move around the world).
3. Character => This is a kind of Pawn that in addition has extra functionality built in specifically for bipedal character movement.

## Creating The Component

For our tanks, we **do** need input control, but we **don't** need all the bipedal character movement functionality as we will handle movement ourselves. This means that Pawn is a good base class for us to use here.

Create the BasePawn component via the usual menu.

As mentioned, this should be a kind of **Pawn** so make sure it's selected as a base class.

Can leave the settings in the wizard otherwise untouched (except changing the name). We call it BasePawn.

Note that it will generate as **ABasePawn** since the A prefix indicates an actor of some kind.

## Adding Capsule Property

Next we want to add a property for a capsule collider which the pawn will use to detect collisions.

Both the player tank, and the enemy towers will have these collision capsules so it's part of the base pawn.

We can specify the property with forward declaration like so.

```cpp
UPROPERTY()
class UCapsuleComponent* CapsuleComponent;
```

---
## Creating A Capsule

When we drag and drop the BasePawn actor into the world, we would like it to always come with several components attached for functionality:

1. A static mesh representing the base/lower body of the pawn
2. A static mesh representing the upper body of the pawn
3. A capsule collider for physics
4. A projectile spawning point for the projectiles that will be fired

Since we added the CapsuleComponent property, we can go ahead and spawn a **UCapsuleComponent** as a sub object of this actor/pawn.

In our constructor we can use the following to create the component/sub-object

```cpp
CapsuleComponent = CreateDefaultSubobject<UCapsuleComponent>(TEXT("Collider"));
```

Additionally, we want the transform of this CapsuleComponent to be the transform of the pawn, or rather, we want the CapsuleComponent to be the RootComponent of the pawn. We can go ahead and set this in the constructor as well.

```cpp
RootComponent = CapsuleComponent;
```

We also actually need to include the header file for access to the UCapsuleComponent

```cpp
#include "Components/CapsuleComponent.h"
```
