In toon tanks, there are two kinds of tanks that can move around the level and shoot. These are the **player** and **enemy** tanks.

Since they have the same basic functionality but differ in how they're controlled (either by AI or player input), we should have a base class to implement the common functionality.

## Actor Types

In Unreal, there are three kinds of actor which have varying degrees of functionality.

1. Actor => This is a basic kind of actor that can be placed in the world, and has the ability to have components attached to it including visuals, etc.
2. Pawn => This is an Actor that additionally has the ability to be possessed by a controller and can receive and react to user input (e.g. to move around the world).
3. Character => This is a kind of Pawn that in addition has extra functionality built in specifically for bipedal character movement.

## Creating The Component

For our tanks, we **do** need input control, but we **don't** need all the bipedal character movement functionality as we will handle movement ourselves. This means that Pawn is a good base class for us to use here.

Create the BasePawn component via the usual menu.

As mentioned, this should be a kind of **Pawn** so make sure it's selected as a base class.

Can leave the settings in the wizard otherwise untouched (except changing the name). We call it BasePawn.

Note that it will generate as **ABasePawn** since the A prefix indicates an actor of some kind.
