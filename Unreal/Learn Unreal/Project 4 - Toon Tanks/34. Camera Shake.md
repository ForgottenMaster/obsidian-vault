To add a bit of depth along with the particles and sound effects, let's add a camera shake when the projectile hits something or when a pawn dies.

# Creating The Shakes

Unreal provides the class necessary to define a camera shake, and we just go ahead and create some blueprint subclasses for them.

The camera shakes are defined as an oscillation of a wave with a certain form. For these we'll be specifically using a sine wave which oscillates up/down, back/forth, left/right depending on the axes defined.

## Creating BP_HitCameraShake

Create a new **Blueprint Class** and as the parent we will pick **LegacyCameraShake** which used to be called **MatineeCameraShake**.

![[Showing Selecting LegacyCameraShake As Parent.png]]

Open the blueprint class we created and we will want to fill some of the variables out here.

The top section is the timing of the camera shake, the duration etc. which will be as follows.

- **Oscillation Duration** => The actual duration the camera shake lasts for.
- **Oscillation Blend in Time** => This isn't a time but a normalized value between 0 and 1 giving the proportion of the duration that blending in will happen over.
- **Oscillation Blend Out Time** => This is similar to the above but defines the proportion at the end of the duration over which the effect is blended out.

In our case we'll say the shake lasts for 0.25 seconds and blends in over the first 5% of this duration, and blends out over the last 5%.

The values we set per axis are:

- **Amplitude** => The multiplier on the unscaled sine wave amplitude to apply. Makes the sine wave taller or shorter.
- **Frequency** => The multiplier on the unscaled sine wave frequency to apply. Makes the sine wave faster or slower.
- **Initial Offset** => We can start at a specific point in the sine wave but we'll just leave it random here.
- **Waveform** => We can pick between Sine Wave and Perlin Noise, but we want sine wave.

## Creating BP_DeathCameraShake

Create another class but set the values as such in order to create a more violent and slightly different shake to hits.

We don't move on the Z axis but do on the others.

# Defining The Properties

We want to go ahead and be able to define properties to hold these blueprint classes in code so we can play them.

Unreal provides a way to play the camera shakes but it uses class references that are derived from **UCameraShakeBase**.

We'll go ahead and add the properties into **AProjectile**

```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category = "Combat")
TSubclassOf<UCameraShakeBase> HitCameraShakeClass;
```

And into **ABasePawn** as well for the death class.

```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category = "Combat")
TSubclassOf<UCameraShakeBase> DeathCameraShakeClass;
```

# Binding The Properties

We can open up our projectile blueprint in the editor now and bind the hit camera shake class to our **BP_HitCameraShake**.

And in both of the pawn classes for tower and tank, we'll bind the death shake class.

# Playing The Shakes

Now everything is defined and set up, we need to go into the code again and trigger the hit and shake effects.

Firstly we'll add the code needed into **AProjectile::OnHit** for playing the hit shake when the projectile hits something.

```cpp
if (HitCameraShakeClass != nullptr)
{
	GetWorld()->GetFirstPlayerController()->ClientStartCameraShake(HitCameraShakeClass);
}
```

We first get the current world that the projectile is in, since Unreal supports multiple worlds.

The camera shake will be played on a specific client, and the player controller is something that is local to the client, which is why camera shakes are played on the player controller.

We can get the first player controller and know it's us because this isn't a multiplayer game!

We can put similar code into the **ABasePawn::HandleDestruction** method as well.

```cpp
if (DeathCameraShakeClass != nullptr)
{
	GetWorld()->GetFirstPlayerController()->ClientStartCameraShake(DeathCameraShakeClass);
}
```

Compile and open the project!

# Testing

After running the game, we should see the camera shakes something like shown.
