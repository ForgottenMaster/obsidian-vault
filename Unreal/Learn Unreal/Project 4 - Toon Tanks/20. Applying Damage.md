There's a callback now on HealthComponent to detect the damage events that will be sent, and we can decrement the health of the component in the callback which is further down.

However we first need to make the projectile able to apply damage when it hits something.

---
# Adding DamageAmount Property

Firstly in the projectile class, we'll want to determine how much damage the projectile will do. We can do this with a property that's editable so we can configure it in blueprints/editor if we would like to.

```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category = "Combat")
float DamageAmount = 20.0f;
```

---
# Setting Projectile Owner

In order to be able to check ownership when sending the damage event on a hit, we'll need the projectile to be owned by the correct actor/controller (so can check if it hits an enemy or friendly).

In ABasePawn where we spawn the projectile.

```cpp
AProjectile* const Projectile = World->SpawnActor<AProjectile>(ProjectileClass, Location, Rotation);
Projectile->SetOwner(this);
```

---

# Sending Damage Event

When the projectile hits something, in order to send damage event to the thing it's hitting, there's the **UGameplayStatics::ApplyDamage** function that we're able to use.

Firstly we check that our projectile does indeed have an owner. If it doesn't then this means it's been fired from something that doesn't exist - which is something we don't do.

```cpp
const AActor* const ProjectileOwner = GetOwner();
if (Owner == nullptr)
{
	return;
}
```

Next, we want to get the instigator controller, which is the controller of the ownership chain. In this case will either be the player controller or nothing.

```cpp
AController* const EventInstigator = Owner->GetInstigatorController();
UClass* const DamageTypeClass = UDamageType::StaticClass();
```

The damage type class we're using we can access with the **UDamageType::StaticClass()** static function that will give us a UClass pointer representing the UDamageType class.

Check that the projectile is indeed hitting an enemy so no friendly fire!

```cpp
if (OtherActor != nullptr && OtherActor != this && OtherActor != ProjectileOwner)
```

Now can actually apply the damage and destroy the projectile. Applying damage is a case of using the ApplyDamage static function, and we can call Destroy method to destroy this actor.

```cpp
UGameplayStatics::ApplyDamage(OtherActor, DamageAmount, EventInstigator, this, DamageTypeClass);
Destroy();
```

---
# Applying Damage

Now that we send the request to apply damage to the hit actor, we want to go ahead and handle the damage event on the other side.

This will be inside **UHealthComponent::DamageTaken** where we handle the callback for damage being taken.

```cpp
if (Damage <= 0.0f)
{
	return;
}

Health -= Damage;
UE_LOGFMT(LogTemp, Log, "Actor {0} received {1} damage and now has {2} health remaining.", DamagedActor->GetActorNameOrLabel(), Damage, Health);
```

Firstly, go ahead and check that the damage being applied is at least some positive value. No blanks or healing bullets in this game!

Subtract the damage taken from the current health. We still need to handle game over etc.

I've also added a log entry so we can see if it's been damaged.

---
# Testing

Next we can test that it's all working by firstly making sure all the projectiles disappear on hit, and secondly checking the output logs for our messages.
