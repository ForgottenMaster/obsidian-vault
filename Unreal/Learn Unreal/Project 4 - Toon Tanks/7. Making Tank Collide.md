Next we need to make the tank collide with geometry so that we can't just drive through walls and such.

# Setting The Collision Preset

First thing to do is to set the collision preset so that the tank will actually be able to detect collision with other geometry.

# Making It Sweep

Next thing is to make sure we actually perform a sweep when moving the tank, to make sure it detects the collision and stops short. This is performed by passing the second argument to AddActorLocalOffset as true, which is a boolean that indicates whether we're sweeping or not.

```cpp
AddActorLocalOffset(Velocity * DeltaTime * Value, true);
```
