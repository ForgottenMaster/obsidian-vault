We want to be able to expose the components we've created in BasePawn so that they can be edited when we derive BasePawn to make our **BP_BasePawn** and **BP_BaseTank** classes for the player and enemy respectively.

# UPROPERTY Specifiers

## Details Panel

There are a few specifiers for UPROPERTY when wanting to expose variables in the editor, here are ones relating to visibility and editing:

- **VisibleAnywhere** => This indicates that the property is visible (but not editable) both in a blueprint class and also in instances of the class.
- **EditAnywhere** => This indicates that the property is editable both in blueprint classes and in instances of the class.
- **VisibleInstanceOnly** => This indicates that the property is visible (but not editable) only in instances of the class.
- **EditInstanceOnly** => This indicates that the property is editable only in instances of the class.
- **VisibleDefaultsOnly** => This indicates that the property is visible (but not editable) only in the class, but not on instances of the class.
- **EditDefaultsOnly** => This indicates that the property is editable only in the class but not in instances of the class.

## Event Graph

Additionally there are specifiers we can use to control usage and exposure to the blueprint event graph (not the details panel).

- **BlueprintReadWrite** => This indicates that the property is readable and writable from the blueprint event graph.
- **BlueprintReadOnly** => This indicates that the property is read only in the blueprint event graph.

## Meta

When using the above attributes to expose to the event graph, by default exposing private members are not allowed. We can however allow it through the use of a meta specifier.

We can use it as follows (in the UPROPERTY macro).

```cpp
meta = (AllowPrivateAccess = "true")
```

This allows the macro to access the private member.

## Category

We can also give them a category to group them in the details panel. This is fairly straightforward using the category specifier as follows.

```cpp
Category = "Some Category"
```

# Adding Specifiers To BasePawn

We can now go ahead and add the following specifiers to the properties of our BasePawn class.

```cpp
UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere, BlueprintReadOnly, Category = "Components", meta = (AllowPrivateAccess = "true"))
```

# Making BP_PawnTank

This subclass will be the subclass for the player tank. We can right-click to make a blueprint child class as we have done before.

![[Making A BasePawn Subclass.png]]

Call it BP_PawnTank then open it up.

## Setting things up

We can then go ahead and set the static meshes and scale the capsule for the player tank. We also need to position the projectile spawn location (not shown here).

# Making BP_PawnTurret

This subclass will be the subclass for the AI tank. We can right-click to make a blueprint child class as we have done before.

Setting this one up, we end up with the following looking thing.

Again the projectile spawn position is just in front of the turret, though not visible on here.

# Placing

With those made we can go ahead and place them in the level now.
