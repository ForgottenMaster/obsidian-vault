We need to get access to the ATank's APlayerController as we'll use it to get the point in the world that's underneath the mouse cursor.

---
# Add Field For APlayerController

Firstly we need to make a field that will store the player controller pointer once we get access to it.

```cpp
APlayerController* PlayerController;
```

---
# Override BeginPlay

The BeginPlay method is called whenever the actor is possessed and inside we can get the controller that's possessing it.

It's a protected method so will need to be inside a protected section in the header.

```cpp
protected:
	void BeginPlay() override;
```

Inside the BeginPlay method, we want to get the current controller which we can get with **GetController** however this returns an AController pointer.

We want an APlayerController pointer so we have to use **Cast** to get it. BeginPlay therefore looks like this.

```cpp
void ATank::BeginPlay()
{
	Super::BeginPlay();
	PlayerController = Cast<APlayerController>(GetController());
}
```
