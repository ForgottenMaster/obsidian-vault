At the moment, the Fire method is simply rendering a debug sphere at the projectile spawn point. However we want it to actually spawn the projectile class we made.

The main problem is that we'll be spawning the class from **code** but the class we want to spawn is defined in **data** (blueprints). How can we reference a data only class from code? We'll take a look!

# The TSubclassOf< T > Type

This type is one that we can turn into a UPROPERTY to expose it to the editor (so the correct subclass can be picked).

It stores a UClass instance, which is a reflective description of a class, and allows us to spawn instances of that class.

The TSubclassOf< T > type, only allows picking and storing of classes that are a subclass of type T, in our case this will be AProjectile.

Let's go ahead and define a UPROPERTY of this type in our **ABasePawn** class.

```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly, Category = "Combat")
TSubclassOf<class AProjectile> ProjectileClass;
```

When we open a subclass of ABasePawn (BP_PawnTank or BP_PawnTurret), we can now see this property exists, and only allows us to select from AProjectile subclasses.

We'll select BP_Projectile as this class has the static mesh correctly set up in data.

# Spawning In Code

Next, inside the Fire method we can spawn instances of this class. There is a method on **UWorld** called **SpawnActor**.

This is templated, and takes a C++ class base, but also allows us to pass a **UClass** instance into this method to allow us to spawn some unknown subclass (e.g. reference set up in data).

Our FIre function now looks as follows.

```cpp
const FVector Location = ProjectileSpawnPoint->GetComponentLocation();
const FRotator Rotation = ProjectileSpawnPoint->GetComponentRotation();
UWorld* const World = GetWorld();
World->SpawnActor<AProjectile>(ProjectileClass, Location, Rotation);
```

The location and rotation come directly from the projectile spawn point actor. We use our ProjectileClass variable (which holds a UClass instance describing some subclass of AProjectile) as the class to spawn.

# Checking

We can check if it's working now by running the game and seeing (for now, static) projectiles being spawned instead of the debug spheres being rendered.
