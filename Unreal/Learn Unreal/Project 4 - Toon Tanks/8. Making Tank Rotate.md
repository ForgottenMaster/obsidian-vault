We can now bind to the rotation keys (A/D) to control how the tank rotates. This is pretty much the same as forward/backward movement except instead of adding a local **offset** we add a local **rotation**.

---
# Adding The Angular Speed Property

First of all we go ahead and add the angular speed property to the tank class.

```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category = "Movement")
double AngularSpeed = 90.0;
```

---
# Bind The Turn Function

Next we will want to bind a turn function to the Turn axis mapping so it can be called for us to handle the A/D value.

```cpp
PlayerInputComponent->BindAxis("Turn", this, &ATank::Turn);
```

---
# Implement The Turn Function

The Turn function implementation is about the same as the move forward one, except we use the angular axis, and we use a local rotate instead. We need to set AngularSpeed as the yaw value.

```cpp
const FRotator AngularVelocity = FRotator(0.0, AngularSpeed, 0.0);
const double DeltaTime = UGameplayStatics::GetWorldDeltaSeconds(this);
AddActorLocalRotation(AngularVelocity * DeltaTime * Value, true);
```
