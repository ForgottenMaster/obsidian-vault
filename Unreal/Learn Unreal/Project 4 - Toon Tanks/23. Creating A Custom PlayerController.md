Next we want to create a custom PlayerController (similar to how we created a custom [[21. Creating Game Mode|game mode]]).

This will allow us to have our custom logic available to code if needed.

---
# Creating The PlayerController

First we can create a new class derived from **PlayerController** which will be called **ToonTanksPlayerController**.

This is straightforward through the now familiar approach.

We then go ahead and create a child class visible and appropriate for use in blueprints.

# Setting The Player Controller Class

Next, in our custom game mode blueprint, we'll want to go ahead and set the custom player controller class to be used.

# Adding Method To Set Player Enabled State

Next thing we want to do is to add a method to the player controller class in code that can be called from our game mode logic and will allow us to set the player enabled state.

The declaration in the header is simple enough.

```cpp
public:
	void SetPlayerEnabledState(bool bPlayerEnabled);
```

In the definition in the cpp file, we implement as such.

```cpp
void AToonTanksPlayerController::SetPlayerEnabledState(bool bPlayerEnabled)
{
	APawn* const ControlledPawn = GetPawn();
	if (bPlayerEnabled)
	{
		ControlledPawn->EnableInput(this);
	}
	else
	{
		ControlledPawn->DisableInput(this);
	}
	bShowMouseCursor = bPlayerEnabled;
}
```

Firstly we can get the APawn that this controller is possessing with the **GetPawn** method.

Next, we can call either **EnableInput** or **DisableInput** on the controlled pawn, depending on the boolean we're passing in.

Finally we want to show the mouse cursor if enabled, and hide if disabled. So we set the value of **bShowMouseCursor**.

---
# Stash Player Controller In Game Mode

Now we go to our custom game mode class and add a variable in which to stash our player controller.

```cpp
class AToonTanksPlayerController* Controller;
```

We look this up in BeginPlay like we do with the player pawn. Again we need to cast as the lookup method returns a pointer of type APlayerController.

```cpp
Controller = Cast<AToonTanksPlayerController>(UGameplayStatics::GetPlayerController(this, 0));
```

---
# Change ActorDied Method

Next we can use the new method for disabling the player when the player pawn dies, instead of doing the work manually inside the ActorDied method.

After replacement the ActorDied method on the game mode will look as follows.

```cpp
void AToonTanksGameMode::ActorDied(AActor* DeadActor)
{
	if (DeadActor == Tank)
	{
		Tank->HandleDestruction();
		if (Controller != nullptr)
		{
			Controller->SetPlayerEnabledState(false);
		}
	}
	else if (ATower* const DestroyedTower = Cast<ATower>(DeadActor))
	{
		DestroyedTower->HandleDestruction();
	}
}
```

# Set Crosshairs Mouse Cursor

Since it's a shooting game, we'll go ahead and change the default mouse cursor type to crosshairs in the editor. We do this via an option on the player controller blueprint asset we have.

![[Changing Mouse Cursor Type.png]]

Currently the mouse cursor isn't being shown because we only call our SetPlayerEnabledState method to disable a player and not to enable them.
