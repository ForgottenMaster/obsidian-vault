We will need to be able to pick items up during this game to be able to put them in the appropriate places to activate game elements.

Firstly we'll take a small detour and set up a statue in one of the cells with a nice little spotlight to highlight it, which will look like this (no need to explain setting these up, it's covered previously).

## What Are Scene Components?

We have previously seen how to make an [[7. Creating A Mover Actor Component|actor component]] in Unreal which is a component that does not have any notion of a Transform by itself, but can attach to an actor and use that actor's Transform.

However, there is a subtype of actor component called **scene components** in Unreal which comes with its own Transform and can form a hierarchy with other scene components.

The Transform of a given scene component will be calculated from the hierarchy leading down to it (with the actor defining the base Transform).

An example of a scene component hierarchy can be found in **BP_Player** which is also where we'll add our own.

## Creating The Grabber Component

Creating a new scene component is the same as creating a new regular actor component, we just need to pick the correct base class.

We can go ahead and fill in the next screen with the name of our component which will be **Grabber**

## Adding Grabber To The Camera

As mentioned before, scene components can attach to other scene components in a hierarchy. Let's go ahead and add the Grabber as a child of the camera scene component so that it will follow the camera's transform.

Click the camera component and then click the Add button

We can then go ahead and search for the new Grabber component, and it will add as a child of the camera!

## Testing Grabber

We can go ahead and test the Grabber component by grabbing the component position and rotation and printing those out with the following code.

```cpp
void UGrabber::TickComponent(float DeltaTime, ELevelTick TickType, FActorComponentTickFunction* ThisTickFunction)
{
	Super::TickComponent(DeltaTime, TickType, ThisTickFunction);
	const FVector Location{ GetComponentLocation() };
	const FRotator Rotation{ GetComponentRotation() };
	const FString LocationString{ Location.ToCompactString() };
	const FString RotationString{ Rotation.ToCompactString() };
	UE_LOGFMT(LogTemp, Log, "Location: {0}, Rotation: {1}", LocationString, RotationString);
}
```

When we run the project now, and move/rotate the camera we can see the output changing as the location and rotation of our Grabber also changes with it.
