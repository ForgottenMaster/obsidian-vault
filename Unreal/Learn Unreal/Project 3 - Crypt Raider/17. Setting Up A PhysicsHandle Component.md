When we press to grab, we want to be able to grab the statue (or whatever else is in front of us that's grabbable). But we want to move it around while respecting physics.

To do this, Unreal gives us a utility component called **UPhysicsHandleComponent** that we can add to the player.

We then need to look up this component in our UGrabber component.

---
## Including The Header File

In order to be able to reference the UPhysicsHandleComponent in code, we need to include the appropriate header file in our **Grabber.cpp** file.

```cpp
#include "PhysicsEngine/PhysicsHandleComponent.h"
```

---
## Defining A Field

We'll want to look up the physics handle component when the simulation begins and store it in a member variable.

We can store this by pointer and it doesn't need to be exposed or anything, so we should forward declare the type.

```cpp
class UPhysicsHandleComponent;
```

And then in our private member section, we can add it as a pointer.

```cpp
UPhysicsHandleComponent* PhysicsHandle{ nullptr };
```

---
## Checking For Owner

In our BeginPlay method we first want to ensure that the Grabber that we're running with actually has an Owner. Since GetOwner can return a pointer - we should check the returned pointer to make sure it's not null before using it.

```cpp
const AActor* const Owner{ GetOwner() };
if (Owner == nullptr)
{
	ensureAlwaysMsgf(false, TEXT("UGrabber \"%s\" does not have an Owner."), *GetPathName());
	DestroyComponent();
	return;
}
```

Explanations:

- **ensureAlwaysMsgf** => This evaluates the first (boolean) expression (which here we say is always false, since we've checked above). If it fails then the formatted error specified is logged
- **GetPathName** => This method gets the full path of the object, helping designers and coders identify the actual instance. It return an FString but we need to use the dereference operator to get the raw string from it
- **DestroyComponent** => This will destroy this component, disallowing it to be used elsewhere down the line

---
## Checking For Physics Handle

We can use a similar block of code to get the physics handle component that we'll be using.

```cpp
PhysicsHandle = Owner->FindComponentByClass<UPhysicsHandleComponent>();
if (PhysicsHandle == nullptr)
{
	ensureAlwaysMsgf(false, TEXT("Actor \"%s\" does not have a UPhysicsHandleComponent which is required by the UGrabber component. Please add one."), *Owner->GetPathName());
	DestroyComponent();
	return;
}
```

The only new thing here really is the line

```cpp
PhysicsHandle = Owner->FindComponentByClass<UPhysicsHandleComponent>();
```

The **FindComponentByClass** method is a templated method, and returns either a non-null pointer if that actor had the component, or a null pointer if it doesn't.

Again this lets us detect setup issues. If we run this without adding the component we see the following.

When we add the physics handle component, this error goes away and we're all set up correctly!
