As well as drawing [[13. Grab Distance And Debug Lines#Drawing The Line|debug lines]], Unreal also lets us draw other debug shapes. In this case we'll use a debug sphere to indicate either the hit point on the statue, or the end of the cast if we didn't hit it.

---
## Include The Header

We included the header when drawing the [[13. Grab Distance And Debug Lines#Including The Correct Header|debug lines]], but for a reminder, need to include

```cpp
#include "DrawDebugHelpers.h"
```

---
## Debug Sphere Function

The general format for the debug sphere drawing is as follows

```cpp
DrawDebugSphere(
	World, 
	Center, 
	Radius, 
	Segments, 
	Color, 
	bPersistentLines, 
	LifeTime
);
```

The parameters are explained as follows:

1. World => The UWorld that we are drawing in
2. Center => The center location of the debug sphere that we're drawing
3. Radius => The radius of the debug sphere
4. Segments => The number of segments to draw the sphere using
5. Color => The FColor that we want to display the sphere in
6. bPersistentLines => Whether or not the lines remain after being drawn
7. LifeTime => If bPersistentLines is false, then this is the time in seconds after which the debug sphere disappears

## Drawing A Debug Sphere If Hit

If an actor is hit, then we can draw the debug sphere at the hit location. We'll put all the parameters in variables for clarity at the call site (avoids magic numbers, etc.)

```cpp
const FVector Center{ HitResult.ImpactPoint };
const float Radius{ 10.0f };
const int32 Segments{ 10 };
const FColor Color{ FColor::Green };
const bool bPersistentLines{ false };
const float LifeTime{ 5.0f };
DrawDebugSphere(World, Center, Radius, Segments, Color, bPersistentLines, LifeTime);
```

When we run the game and hit the gargoyle with our grab we can see that we get a green debug sphere at the point we were looking at (it remains for 5 seconds).

## Drawing A Debug Sphere For Miss

We can go ahead and draw a red debug sphere for a miss as well for completion sake. Since we won't have hit anything, we can just draw it at the end point of the cast.

```cpp
const FVector Center{ End };
const float Radius{ 10.0f };
const int32 Segments{ 10 };
const FColor Color{ FColor::Red };
const bool bPersistentLines{ false };
const float LifeTime{ 5.0f };
DrawDebugSphere(World, Center, Radius, Segments, Color, bPersistentLines, LifeTime);
```

When we do a grab that misses we see the red sphere.
