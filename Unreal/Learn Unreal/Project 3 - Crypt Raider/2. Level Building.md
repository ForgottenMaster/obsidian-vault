Firstly we need to actually build the level which we will be applying behaviour to. The flow of logic is as follows:

1. The player starts in a courtyard area of the dungeon
2. The player can walk through a semi open door into a room with some jail cells and a secret door
3. The player places a statue on a pedestal to unlock the secret door
4. Player descends down the revealed staircase and can find the mauseleum
5. There's treasure on a pedestal there, but taking it will close the door
6. Player needs to put a vase on the pedestal to open the door again

## Split viewports

When building a level, it'll be handy to have more than the single perspective viewpoint of the level.

In particular we can split our viewports and have 4.

Unreal allows us to easily change our single viewport into a 4-way split view by clicking this button.

This will give us the perspective view that we wanted, but also 3 wireframe views from the back, right, and top that will make positioning of kit pieces easier.

Since we don't have any lighting yet, change the perspective viewport to **Unlit**. The resulting view should look as follows.

## General tips

I won't go through the entire level design process here because it's just dragging and dropping pieces from the modular kit asset pack to assemble our rooms.

However, there are a few things that will come in handy during this process.
### Swapping static meshes out

If we have for example a wall section that's just a plain old wall, but we want a bit more decoration, the modular kit, due to pieces all having the same size, we can easily swap out the rendered mesh.

For example if we've placed a regular **SM_Dungeon_Wall** piece, we can find the static mesh and see a few decorative variants.

### Putting actors into folders

We can organise actors into folders once placed into the world as well. Simply select the actors you want to organise and use this option on the right-click menu.

### Hiding a folder

Sometimes it'll be useful to be able to hide all the actors inside a specific folder - in case we want to only see a specific region of the world for example.

We can show/hide a particular folder with the following option.

Note that this also can show/hide individual actors as well.
