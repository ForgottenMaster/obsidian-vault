For ray casting and other such queries it'll be useful to visualise where the line starts and ends. We can do a quick debug visualization with a handy function in Unreal called **DrawDebugLine**.

---
## Defining The Grab Distance

Firstly we'll need the Grabber to be able to know just how far it'll be looking into the scene when determining what it can grab.

This we can add as a UPROPERTY to the Grabber script so that we can easily tweak it in editor.

```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)
float MaxGrabDistance{ 400 };
```

---
## Including The Correct Header

Before we can use the DrawDebugLines function to visualize where we're gonna do the cast, we need to include the correct header file.

```cpp
#include "DrawDebugHelpers.h"
```

Which will give us access to the function we want along with some others.

---
## Drawing The Line

Go ahead and change the contents of the TickComponent method of the Grabber to be as follows.

```cpp
void UGrabber::TickComponent(float DeltaTime, ELevelTick TickType, FActorComponentTickFunction* ThisTickFunction)
{
	Super::TickComponent(DeltaTime, TickType, ThisTickFunction);
	const UWorld* const World{ GetWorld() };
	const FVector Start{ GetComponentLocation() };
	const FVector Forward{ GetForwardVector() };
	const FVector Offset{ Forward * MaxGrabDistance };
	const FVector End{ Start + Offset };
	const FColor Color{FColor::Red};
	DrawDebugLine(World, Start, End, Color);
}
```

The Start location will be at the component's location, and the End location will be a point MaxGrabDistance units away in the forward direction.

---
## Testing

Compiling and running, and then ejecting from the player rig shows us that we do indeed see a line drawn from the Grabber location (location of the camera).
