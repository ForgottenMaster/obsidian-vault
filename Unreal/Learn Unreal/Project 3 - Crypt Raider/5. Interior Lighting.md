In the [[4. Lumen & Light Bleed|previous]] section, we went ahead and blocked out as much of the dungeon as we could in order to have the interior space as dark as we can.

This will allow us now to add our dungeon lighting which will consist of torches and chandeliers.

## Making a Torch Child Class

First off is to create a blueprint child class for us to fiddle around with the properties of. Let's create one called **BP_Torch_Dungeon**

Dragging and dropping into the world we can see that we already get a nice little base to start from. It has a mesh, a light, and particles for the fire.

However we need to modify this a little.

## Casting Shadows

Currently the torch does not cast shadows, but we can easily have it cast shadows by selecting the point light component and checking the appropriate box.

The one thing here is that with shadow casting enabled, the torch now casts a shadow with it's own mesh!

We can prevent this by disabling shadow casting against the torch mesh which is shown below (along with the results).

## Reducing Intensity

The light is a bit too bright for the dungeon/crypt mood of this little project. We can go ahead and first turn down the intensity of the torch.

Secondly we can reduce the actual range of the torch, which will also be a performance boost.

## Applying Changes To Blueprint

I've made these changes to the instance of the torch so we can see the effect in the level, but we want to apply the changes to the blueprint itself so all the instances of this torch look the same.

We can apply any modifications to an instance to its blueprint class with this handy button.

## Chandelier

As an additional option for lighting, we'll make a child class of **BP_Chandalier** as well, but this one we need to explicitly add the point light to.

The properties of the light are also changed there on the actor rather than on a point light component in this case.

After fiddling with the properties a little we get something that looks like this.

## Lighting The Level

With the two blueprints above, and any potential different variants we care to make, we can go ahead and light up the interior space of the dungeon as we like. Here's a quick flythrough of the dungeon.
