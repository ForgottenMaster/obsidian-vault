Within our [[7. Creating A Mover Actor Component|actor component]] we will want to be able to access properties of the actor itself. We have a few things available to us, which as a test will use to print out the actor name and location.

---
## Getting The Owner Actor

An actor component can be owned by an actor, or it could have no owner presumably if it's detached or in a pool etc.

We can get the owner if it exists with the **GetOwner** method of the actor component.

This returns a pointer and we should check its validity before trying to use it.

```cpp
if (const AActor* const owner{ GetOwner() })
{
	// do stuff with owner here
}
```

---
## Getting The Actor Name

Once we have an instance of an AActor, we can get its name or label in the editor using the following method.

```cpp
const FString name{ owner->GetActorNameOrLabel() };
```

---
## Printing The Location

We can get the location of the actor as we have before with the **GetLocation** method on the AActor.

However we can't directly log it with **UE_LOGFMT** and so will need to get a string representation of the FVector type.

We can do this with the following.

```cpp
const FVector location{ owner->GetActorLocation() };
const FString locationString{ location.ToCompactString() };
```

---
## Logging

Finally we can go ahead and log the name and location to make sure it's being retrieved correctly.

Remember to include the header!

```cpp
#include "Logging/StructuredLog.h"
```

And log with the following line (we just use the LogTemp category, but this could be anything really).

```cpp
UE_LOGFMT(LogTemp, Log, "Actor with name \"{0}\" has location {1}", name, locationString);
```

---
## Checking

We can now check in the editor by running and we'll see that this Mover instance does indeed print the name and location of the wall piece it's attached to.
