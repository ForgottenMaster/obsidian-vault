In the [[23. Detecting Overlapping Actors|previous]] section, we were able to get all overlapping actors with our component, but in order to activate the secret door we want to check that it's the correct one.

We could just compare names....but it's not reliable enough because names can change.

Instead we can rely on the fact that we can add a tag to the actor.

## Adding A Tag To The Statue

If you look in the details panel when the statue is selected, you can see that we can add any number of string tags to the actor (also to the component but for now we'll add an actor tag).

We can give any name we like, but let's call it **Unlock1**

## Specifying Tag In Component

Now that we have the ability to add a tag to the statue, we need to also tell the component what the tag should be that triggers it.

We'll add the following UPROPERTY to Trigger.h

```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)
FName TriggerTag;
```

---
## Filtering Tag

Then in the cpp file we need to filter the actors that are overlapping, so we only process those that have this tag.

Change the contents of the range-based for loop inside TickComponent to.

```cpp
if (OverlappingActor != nullptr && OverlappingActor->ActorHasTag(TriggerTag))
{
	UE_LOGFMT(LogTemp, Log, "Triggering!");
}
```

---
## Specifying On Component

Remember to add the tag to the component!

## Result

Now when we move into the alcove with the statue, it still only prints the statue out.
