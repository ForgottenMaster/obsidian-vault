Once we do a trace to see what we have grabbed and the position at which we grab it - we need to actually do the grab itself. This will attach the object to the PhysicsHandle component and then moving the PhysicsHandle component around will move the object (subject to physical constraints).

## Making The Statue Movable

Firstly we need to make the statue actually able to be moved by physics, which means we need to enable **Movable** and **Simulate Physics**.

The Simulate Physics option is located under the Physics tab.

## Grabbing

In order to grab the statue, we can use the impact point that we got from the sphere sweep and attach the object at that location to the PhysicsHandle. Then we move the physics handle around.

In order to attach the object to the PhysicsHandle we can do the following:

```cpp
UPrimitiveComponent* const Component{ HitResult.GetComponent() };
const FName InBoneName{ NAME_None };
const FVector Location{ HitResult.ImpactPoint };
const FRotator Rotation{ GetComponentRotation() };
PhysicsHandle->GrabComponentAtLocationWithRotation(Component, InBoneName, Location, Rotation);
```

We don't need a bone name, but this would be used if we were wanting to grab a specific bone of a skeleton for example. In our case we just pass it as **NAME_None**.

## Adding A Hold Distance

After we've grabbed the object, we'll want to know how far in front of the camera/Grabber we want it to be held.

We'll add this to the Grabber script to define a distance to hold it as being half as far as the initial grab.

```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)
float HoldDistance{ 200 };
```

---
## Moving

After grabbing the object, we need to move the PhysicsHandle component around as we move the Grabber component.

We can do this in the **TickComponent** method of the Grabber component.

```cpp
const FVector Location{ GetComponentLocation() };
const FVector Forward{ GetForwardVector() };
const FVector NewLocation{ Location + Forward * HoldDistance };
const FRotator NewRotation{ GetComponentRotation() };
PhysicsHandle->SetTargetLocationAndRotation(NewLocation, NewRotation);
```

This makes us hold the physics handle (with the object attached) at a location HoldDistance in front of us.

---
## Result

We can now grab the statue and move it around as shown.
