Since we're using Unreal Engine 5, we will be using the new lighting model, called Lumen. It seems that Lumen, strangely enough, works best with movable lights.

First thing to do then is to select each of our sky light and directional light in turn and change their mobility to be movable.

There are a couple of problems with using Lumen however, which will look at right now.

## Unsupported Feature

The first problem is that the materials in use here are using a feature in their shader graph that Lumen doesn't support yet.

This means that we see this kind of weird artifact on the material due to the rendering of it. For example look at a wall in the courtyard.

We need to go ahead and fix the shader. First we need to find the actual material asset that contains the shader however.

We can select one of the wall pieces and scroll to where the material is listed. Clicking the little button will find it and select it in the content drawer for us.

The only thing is that this is not the material itself but a material **instance** which contains additional properties and such.

We can find the material itself by asking to navigate to the parent of this asset.

This will find it in the content browser but in an annoying quirk, will minimize the content browser :(

Re-open the content browser and double-click to open the material graph.

The thing we need to disconnect is this wire here for **Pixel Depth Offset** which we can go ahead and disconnect by holding **Alt** and clicking on it.

Saving and letting it rebuild the materials, we can now see it's fixed the artifacts on the wall.

## Light Bleed

Because Lumen is using the rendering pipeline, light will pass through the back side of any actors that are only rendered from one side.

In particular, the ceilings of the dungeon kit are back face culled. This means the light will illuminate the interior of the dungeon and crypt as shown here.

We can work around this by just putting some geometry above that isn't culled. This geometry will then block the light from getting inside.

For example, we can place floor panels above the ceiling.
