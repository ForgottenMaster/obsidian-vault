We have the ability to grab, move, and release our gargoyle statue now. We will need a way to identify that the gargoyle has been placed in the alcove.

We will do this by using object responses between the gargoyle and a trigger volume within the alcove.

## Review Trace Channels

So [[11. Adding A Trace Channel#Adding The Channel|previously]] we dealt with trace channels, and also with how an object responds to a trace channel.

As a visual overview, consider the following diagram showing two different trace channels:

1. **Weapon** => This trace channel is used to see if something is hit by a bullet
2. **Visibility** => This trace channel is used to see if something is visible, can be seen by sight (e.g. an NPC)

![[Diagram Of Trace Channels.png]]

We can see that a shrub will block visibility as it's opaque, but allow for a bullet to pass through. Conversely, bulletproof glass will block a bullet going through, but as it's see-through will allow visibility.

A brick wall is both opaque and blocks bullets so it's set to block for both traces.

This is easy enough with trace channels and trace responses, because it's only the object that needs to decide how to interact with the trace.

Things get a little more complicated when we want to check how an object responds to another one.

## Object Responses

When we have two objects colliding with one another, we can set up how each interacts with objects of another type. For example in the following diagram.

![[Diagram Of Object Responses.png]]

We can see that the shrub for example, says that it should only overlap with the Pawn but not block it. However the pawn says it should block the shrub (the shrub is of the WorldStatic type).

How do we rectify this when the pawn and shrub collide? Should we block, or overlap?

Unreal will take the **least blocking** interaction in all cases. This means that the only way two objects block each other is if they **both** say they should.

The table below shows the final verdict given two objects that have their own opinions of what should happen with the collision.

## Creating A BP_Secret_Door Blueprint

Firstly, let's turn the alcove (which already has a Mover on it so it can be lowered) into a blueprint.

---
## Creating A Trigger Component

Next let's make a C++ component which inherits from **Box Component** since this will give us the ability to place the object in the scene but also specify extents for the box.

![[Making A New Component From Box Component.png]]

However Unreal doesn't generate the component with the ability to be viewable in the editor. We need to replace the UCLASS line with the following in the component header file.

```cpp
UCLASS( ClassGroup=(Custom), meta=(BlueprintSpawnableComponent) )
```

---
## Adding The Component

We'll go ahead and add the Trigger component to the alcove, and change the Box Extents property to be large enough to detect things going into it.

![[Adding The Trigger Component To The Secret Door.png]]

And then the transform and extents are set as follows too.

## Hook Into Overlap Events In The Event Graph

For a test, let's print out the name of whatever object is overlapping our trigger volume. This is easy enough to do in our event graph.

![[Event Graph For BP_Secret_Door.png]]

---
## Setting Events Emitted

By default for performance, events from overlapping another object aren't actually emitted . We need to opt-in to those with the following checkbox.

![[Turning Overlap Events On.png]]

We need to do this on **both** our Trigger component, and on the statue object.

## Result

![[+Attachments/Unreal/Learn Unreal/Project 3 - Crypt Raider/21. Overlap Checks/Results.gif]]

Notice that when the statue enters the alcove area, there is the name of the actor printed to the top-left of the screen (BP_Gargoyle_Statue)
