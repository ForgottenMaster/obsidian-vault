We have the ability to detect the grab and release from blueprints and can then do *something* with those events. At the moment we are simply printing out "Grabbed" or "Released", but what we want is to be able to call functionality on our Grabber component instead.

---
## Making Grab And Release Functions

Firstly we need to add the ability to grab (whatever we're looking at), and to release (whatever was grabbed) as two functions that should be callable from blueprint.

The syntax for this in the header is pretty simple.

```cpp
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable)
void Grab();

UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable)
void Release();
```

This is similar to how we expose properties to the editor.

When it comes to implementing these methods, we'll go ahead and move the functionality from TickComponent into the Grab method.

```cpp
void UGrabber::Grab()
{
	if (const UWorld* const World{ GetWorld() })
	{
		const FVector Start{ GetComponentLocation() };
		const FVector Forward{ GetForwardVector() };
		const FVector Offset{ Forward * MaxGrabDistance };
		const FVector End{ Start + Offset };

		FHitResult HitResult{ };
		FQuat Rotation{ FQuat::Identity };
		const FCollisionShape CollisionShape{ FCollisionShape::MakeSphere(GrabRadius) };
		World->SweepSingleByChannel(HitResult, Start, End, Rotation, ECC_GameTraceChannel2, CollisionShape);

		if (const AActor* const HitActor{HitResult.GetActor()})
		{
			UE_LOGFMT(LogTemp, Log, "Started Grabbing Actor: {0}", HitActor->GetActorNameOrLabel());
		}
		else
		{
			UE_LOGFMT(LogTemp, Log, "Grabbed Nothing");
		}
	}
}
```

And the Release will just print a message for now to say we've stopped grabbing.

```cpp
void UGrabber::Release()
{
	UE_LOGFMT(LogTemp, Log, "Released Grabber");
}
```

## Hooking It Up

We can now hook it up in blueprints, although we do need to drag-and-drop the Grabber component into the graph to be able to call methods on it.

## Testing

When we now run, we can see that these methods are called and they do indeed print out our messages!
