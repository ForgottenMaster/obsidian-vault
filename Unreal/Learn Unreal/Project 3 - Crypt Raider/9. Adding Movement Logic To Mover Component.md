Let's add actual movement logic to the Mover actor component so we can make the door lower.

For now, we'll hook up the actual movement to a bool saying whether the component is active or not.

---
## Adding The Properties

We will need a few properties for this script. In order to move something we need to know two bits of information.

One is where the object is heading towards, and the other is the speed it is travelling at.

There are a few different ways we could represent this information but we'll have the following properties.

- An offset from the original/starting location that the object will move to
- The total time over which the movement will occur
- A checkbox indicating whether the actor component should be running or not

We can add these with the following code.

```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) FVector MoveOffset;
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) float MoveTime;
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) bool Running;
```

After setting the values we would like in the editor for this component, it should look something like this.

## More Fields

What we want to do is firstly in BeginPlay calculate the things we will need to be able to run the movement. These are:

1. The TargetLocation that we are aiming towards
2. The speed we are moving at

Let's first make the fields for these

```cpp
FVector TargetLocation;
float MoveSpeed;
```

We can get the original/starting location from the owner actor in BeginPlay and then from that we can calculate the TargetLocation (using MoveOffset).

```cpp
void UMover::BeginPlay()
{
	Super::BeginPlay();
	const AActor* const Owner{ GetOwner() };
	check(Owner != nullptr);
	const FVector StartingLocation = Owner->GetActorLocation();
	TargetLocation = StartingLocation + MoveOffset;
	MoveSpeed = MoveOffset.Length() / MoveTime;
}
```

### A Note On Check

The line in the above code `check(owner != nullptr)` is a call to one of Unreal's assert macros and will terminate if the check fails.

GetOwner can theoretically return a nullptr if a component is currently not attached to an actor.

Trying to call GetActorLocation on a nullptr would be undefined behaviour which is always bad!

We know that we're in BeginPlay so the owner should have been initialised, so this check should always pass, but we need to put it in anyways to downgrade UB to a crash.

## Implementing Movement

We can now implement the actual movement logic into the TickComponent method so it runs over time.

Firstly we need to guard the logic behind a check for the Running checkbox.

```cpp
if (Running)
{
	// logic
}
```

The actual logic will be:
1. Get owner actor
2. Get current location of the owner
3. Determine new location based on speed and target location
4. If we reached the target location, set Running to false

We disable the Running flag once we reach the target location to bypass all of these calculations in future frames.

Let's take a look at these then.

### Get Owner Actor

We've seen this before, it's just GetOwner - again we'll guard it with a check because the actor should exist for the actor component to be ticked, but in case it doesn't, we would rather terminate than do UB.

```cpp
AActor* const Owner{ GetOwner() };
check(Owner != nullptr);
```

### Get Current Location

Again this is something seen before, but to get the current location - just use the available method for that.

```cpp
const FVector CurrentLocation{ Owner->GetActorLocation() };
```

### Determine New Location

This will be something new!

In order to determine the new location, given a target and a speed, along with the elapsed time - we want to interpolate.

However we don't need to do this functionality ourselves because a method exists, **FMath::VInterpConstantTo**

Firstly need to include the correct header file though.

```cpp
#include "Math/UnrealMathUtility.h"
```

We now have access to this method which we can go ahead and use as follows.

```cpp
const FVector NewLocation{ FMath::VInterpConstantTo(CurrentLocation, TargetLocation, DeltaTime, MoveSpeed) };
```

And lastly we can go ahead and set this new location on the actor.

```cpp
Owner->SetActorLocation(NewLocation);
```

### Disabling Running

As an optimisation, if after the update, we have actually reached the target location, then we should disable the Running flag.

We can do this in one line by just setting the Running flag to whether the new location and target location are different or not.

```cpp
Running = NewLocation != TargetLocation;
```

## Making It Mobile

Currently if we try to activate the component then we notice the wall doesn't actually move, and there's an error saying it's flagged as static.

Let's go ahead and set it to be a Movable object in the editor.

## Testing

If all is good then when we check the box, the wall section should move along the offset we've specified over the time we've specified.
