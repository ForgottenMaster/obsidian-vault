In Unreal there is a single **UWorld** but that can contain multiple loaded **ULevel**s which is shown in the image below.

![[How UWorld And ULevel Compose.png]]

A UWorld can actually be initialised from a single persistent ULevel, or from world composition, but that'll likely be covered later.

---
## Accessing UWorld

We can access the current UWorld within an actor or actor component with the built in method  **GetWorld()** which returns a **pointer** to the current UWorld if it exists.

```cpp
const UWorld* const World{ GetWorld() };
```

---
## Getting The Time

We can interact with the UWorld we have retrieved for example getting the current time elapsed that the game has been running for, but first we need to include the appropriate header file.

```cpp
#include "Engine/World.h"
```

We can get the elapsed time in seconds of the simulation (subject to time scaling), but **not** including time spent paused.

We'll go ahead and change the logging part of our TickComponent as a test to print out this TimeSeconds property.

```cpp
const double TimeSeconds{ World->TimeSeconds };
UE_LOGFMT(LogTemp, Log, "Location: {0}, Rotation: {1}, Time: {2}", LocationString, RotationString, TimeSeconds);
```

---
## Testing

We can now run the game and see that the log now contains the elapsed time as well as our position and rotation we had previously.
