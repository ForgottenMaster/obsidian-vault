Now that we can grab the object, we want to be able to release it.

Firstly let's optimise the TickComponent method a little.

## Optimising The TickComponent Method

Currently, the code for TickComponent is **always** trying to set the position and rotation of the grabber, but this will have no effect if there is no grabbed component.

We can simply check if the PhysicsHandle has anything grabbed and modify the TickComponent method to the following.

```cpp
if (PhysicsHandle->GetGrabbedComponent() != nullptr)
{
	// usual contents
}
```

## Implementing Release

The Release method is simple enough to implement as well

```cpp
void UGrabber::Release()
{
	PhysicsHandle->ReleaseComponent();
}
```

---
## The Result

When we run the game, we can now pick up the statue by holding the left mouse button when looking at it, and we can release the statue by releasing the button as shown below.
