Here's a brief overview of the various light types we can use in Unreal, and how they show up in our scene.

We can place these lights all from the **Place Actors** panel

The lighting tab of the place actors panel shows that we have 5 different kinds of light available.

## Point Light

The point light is a light that has a location in the world, but light is emitted in **all directions** from that point.

---
## Spot Light

This light also has a position in the world, but light is only emitted in a **cone** in the forward direction of the light.

## Rect Light

This is similar to a spot light except that instead of light being emitted in a cone, it is emitted in a rectangle/box in front of the light.

## Directional Light

The directional light does not care where it's placed in the world, and will emit light level-wide in the forward direction of the light source.

## Sky Light

This light is used to represent the light emitted from the sky/sun, and will be dependant on the presence of a sky sphere in the world.

We can add a sky sphere to the world, Unreal ships with one so we can simply use that!

You need to enable the checkbox that allows engine content to be shown though for the content drawer to show the engine folder.

Once we place the sky light, and the sky sphere - we need to make sure that we go ahead and recapture the scene to ensure the sky light is giving off the correct light for the skybox.

## Linking Sky Sphere To Directional Light

We can also select a directional light for Unreal to use to determine how the sky sphere should even be rendered, which means we can choose whether it's night, dusk, dawn, day by simply rotating the directional light.

Go into the sky sphere and we can select our directional light here to link to.

After rotating the directional light, Unreal does not directly update the sphere. You need to select the refresh material option for that.
