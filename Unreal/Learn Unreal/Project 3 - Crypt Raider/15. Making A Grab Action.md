We will want to make a grab input action so that the player can pick up and drop the statue or vase as part of the puzzle.

Before UE 5 there were input mappings defined directly in the project settings, but now there is an **Enhanced Input System** which works differently.

## Checking If Enhanced Input Is Being Used

To check if the enhanced input system is setup and in use, we can check in the input section of the project settings to see if these classes are being used.

## Creating An Input Action

The first thing we'll go ahead and do is we'll create a new input action to represent the action of grabbing.

An input action does not know what specific inputs are used to trigger it, but only what kind of values it has, and whether it is currently active or not.

To create a new one for our grab action we can right-click in the content browser and select to create a new one.

We can make one called **IA_Grab** to represent the action of grabbing. It will want to be set up as follows.

The most important field is the circled value type, which for the grab will simply be on or off (digital).

## Creating An Input Mapping Context

The next thing to do is to define a mapping between the actual input the player performs and the action we want to trigger.

The input can be from multiple controller types to allow for a player to use mouse, keyboard, gamepad, etc.

We could add the IA_Grab input action to the existing default mapping context but to demonstrate the entire flow, we'll make one ourselves.

Right-click and select this from the context menu to make a new one.

We can then name it appropriately, and fill it out with the inputs-to-actions mappings that we want. In our case, there's only one mapping which is to trigger the grab.

## Adding The Input Mapping Context

By default, the input mapping context that we had created does not do anything because it's not active on the player controller.

The mappings within an input mapping context will only be applied while it's added - but in our case, we'll just add it to the player controller at setup and leave it active.

We can do this by adding the following to our **BP_Player** blueprint class.

![[Adding Input Mapping Context To Player Controller.png]]

The priority we give when adding the mapping context is an integer and allows us to have a priority list of mapping contexts so that we can't for example perform any player control actions while we have an inventory open.

---
## Reacting To Grab/Release

We can now react to the event of the input action being started and stopped which will correspond to the player grabbing and releasing the object.

Unreal gives us a blueprint node for each input action that might be triggered, and we can react to various states of it.

![[Reacting To Grab And Release.png]]

Here "Started" means "Grabbed" and "Completed" means "Released".

## Testing

We can test that it does what we want now by running the game and then clicking and releasing the left mouse button (or right gamepad trigger if we have one!).
