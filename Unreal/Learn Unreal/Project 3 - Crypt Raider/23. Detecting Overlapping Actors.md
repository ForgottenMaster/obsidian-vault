Now we have a [[22. Enabling Ticking On UTrigger#The Solution|TickComponent]] method active on our Trigger component, we can use it to poll when the gargoyle is overlapping our trigger.

Or more accurately, we can get all the overlapping actors (or components) which we can then filter through if necessary.

**Note:** This probably isn't the best way to handle overlaps as there's likely an event to hook into when a new one occurs. But at the moment just learning about how to get the overlapping actors.

## GetOverlappingActors Method

The **UPrimitiveComponent** base class (which is a type of scene component but which also has additional mesh, material, physics, etc.) provides us with the ability to check for any AActors that are overlapping this component.

```cpp
TArray<AActor*> OverlappingActors;
GetOverlappingActors(OverlappingActors);
```

---
## Looping And Printing

We can then go ahead and iterate over the array using a range-based for loop. Remember to check the pointers in the array.....I think they should all be valid but just in case.

Nothing really new or noteworthy here tbh.

```cpp
for (const AActor* const OverlappingActor : OverlappingActors)
{
	if (OverlappingActor != nullptr)
	{
		UE_LOGFMT(LogTemp, Log, "Overlapping with: {ActorName}", OverlappingActor->GetActorNameOrLabel());
	}
}
```

## Results

Now when we take the gargoyle to the alcove, and make sure both the player pawn and the gargoyle are in the alcove, they both are printed from this C++ code.
