Now we've got the level built and lit, we need to actually set up the player character to run around in it. This actually isn't too bad, but will detail it here.

## Adding Player Start

This first step is easy enough. We need to tell Unreal where to spawn the player by placing a Player Start actor in the level.

We can simply drag and drop into the world from the **Place Actors** panel.

## Fixing Collision On Floor

When we press play, we notice that the player pawn just falls through the floor. This is due to the floor meshes not having any collisions.

Locate the floor mesh in the content drawer and open it.

Click this option to add a simple box collision to the mesh.

![[Adding Box Collision To Mesh.png]]

However this will add a collision that is 0 thickness (because the mesh is a flat plane with 0 thickness). This can cause issues with the collision detection so we'll go ahead and make it 10 units tall, with the top edge under the tile.

Now when we play, we no longer fall through the floor!

## An Issue With The Player Pawn

One thing we notice is that there is a player mesh, we can see the hand when we jump.

Let's fix that!

## Deriving The Player Pawn

Firstly we can go ahead and make a child subclass of the player pawn so that we can make modifications to the actual instance we're using.

This will then make a new player pawn for us that's derived from the one we currently have in the scene.

Open it up and we can see that indeed there are arms!

We can go ahead and clear that mesh and get rid of the arms in our variant.

## Overriding The GameState

We now need to change the project GameState asset to point to this new player pawn asset.

We can do this by going here

![[Creating A New Crypt Raider Game Mode.png]]

Open the new game mode and select the new player pawn subclass we created and edited

## Results

Check that we can now run around in first person and there's no arm flailing when we jump.
