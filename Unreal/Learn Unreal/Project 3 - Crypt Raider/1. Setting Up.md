Crypt raider will be set in a medieval dungeon aesthetic and there is a free asset pack with that style available for us to use, so grab that from the asset store.

## Creating the project

For the project this one will be a first person game, so we don't have to worry about any avatar as such, and we can go ahead and just create using a first person template.

We can set it up with the following.

**NOTE:** The medieval dungeon asset pack is only compatible with Unreal Engine **5.3** so we will use that version for this project.

## Fixing the solution

Unreal engine 5.3.2 does fail to compile when trying to compile the generated solution. We need to actually edit the source code to fix this.

This is fixed in 5.4 but we can't use that as we can't add the asset pack we want to.

Firstly need to change **BgScriptReader.cs** line **1640** 

```diff
- report.NotifyUsers.UnionWith(users);
+ if (users != null)
+ {
+     report.NotifyUsers.UnionWith(users);
+ }
```

And **CheckForHacks** line **87** needs changing too

```diff
- Logger.LogInformation("Scanning files...", FilesToCheck.Count);
+ Logger.LogInformation("Scanning files... [{Arg0}]", FilesToCheck.Count);
```

## Add the asset pack

Next go ahead and add the asset pack to the project. The process is detailed [[9. Importing Assets|Here]] if needed.

## Create a world

We want to go ahead and create a world called **Dungeon** and then set that as our main world. Can refer to [[10. Geometry Brushes#Setting Main As Start Scene|this]] for a refresher on how to set the starting scene.
