We want to be able to move a section of wall to lower it when a statuette is placed within it. In the Obstacle Assault project, we [[3. Compiling C++#Adding A C++ Class|created an actor]] which is an example of an **is-a** relationship (via inheritance).

However a Mover won't be an actor by itself, but this movement will be a capability that can be added to any actor. For this we can create a new actor component.

## Creating The Mover Component

We can go ahead and create and add the new Mover component to an actor in one action.

As an example we would like to be able to lower this wall when a statue is placed into the alcove, so we can click the wall and use this option to create a new C++ component.

This presents a dialog where we can pick a base class we're deriving from if we need to derive a specific base class.

In our case we just want a generic run-of-the-mill actor component.

Clicking next, we will be able to input the name we want - here it's just **Mover** which describes well what the component does.

Clicking Create Class will make the class and add it to the project so that it can be compiled with the rest of the C++ solution.

Remember to actually compile the solution though!

## Adding The Component

Once the Mover component is created and compiled,  we can see it in the list of components for us to add to the actor in the editor.

Simply click it and add it!
