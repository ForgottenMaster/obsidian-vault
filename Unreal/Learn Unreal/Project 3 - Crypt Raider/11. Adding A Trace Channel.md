In order to have the Grabber be able to pick things up, we will need to know what the camera is looking at.

In Unreal there's two broad categories of query which are called traces. These consist of:

1. **Line Trace** => This is a single line from a start point to an end point and can return either the first hit object, or all hit objects. Sometimes called a **ray cast** in other engines.
2. **Geometry Trace** => This can be various shapes such as a sphere and will sweep the shape from a start point to an end point, returning either the first or all hit objects as required. Sometimes called a **sphere  cast** (or capsule cast, etc.) in other engines.

When we do a trace however, we can specify what channels it runs on, which will determine which objects are hit. These are sometimes called **physics layers** in other engines.

## Adding The Channel

Firstly we'll go ahead and create a new trace channel called **Grabber**. Open up the project settings and navigate to the **collision** page.

We can go ahead and add a new trace channel by clicking **New Trace Channel**.

In the little dialog that pops up we can give it a name (Grabber), and also say what the default response of objects is when tracing on this channel.

In our case, we want everything to **not** be grabbable, except for the couple of objects that we specifically say are grabbable.

Therefore our default response is for objects to ignore the trace on this channel.

## Configuring The Gargoyle

We can now go ahead and say that the gargoyle statue is grabbable. We need to create a custom preset for collision though.

Find the collisions section of the actor and we can make a custom preset here.

We can then go ahead and change the Grabber response to **block** which means that this object will block traces using the Grabber channel.
