In the [[21. Overlap Checks#Creating A Trigger Component|previous]] section we created a UTrigger component which allows us to check when something enters it.

We will also need the ability to tick this component, and we can indeed go ahead and add this to the header

```cpp
virtual void TickComponent(float DeltaTime, ELevelTick TickType, FActorComponentTickFunction* ThisTickFunction) override;
```

And this into the cpp file

```cpp
void UTrigger::TickComponent(float DeltaTime, ELevelTick TickType, FActorComponentTickFunction* ThisTickFunction)
{
	Super::TickComponent(DeltaTime, TickType, ThisTickFunction);
}
```

However it will not do anything!

---
## The Problem

The problem is that by default components will be created without tick functionality turned on, and we have to go ahead and turn it on ourselves.

---
## The Solution

We can turn on ticking ability by implementing a custom constructor for our component, and inside the constructor using the following line of code.

```cpp
PrimaryComponentTick.bCanEverTick = true;
```

This turns on the ability to tick the component and if we add a log line to the TickComponent method we can see that it is called once a frame.
