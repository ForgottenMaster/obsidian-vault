We want to be able to have the Grabber sweeping a sphere along its forward vector to detect an object (if any) that's on the Grabber trace channel that we're looking at.

---
## Adding GrabRadius

We first need to add the ability to specify a grab radius for the sphere that we are sweeping to the Grabber component. This is easy enough to add in the header.

```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)
float GrabRadius{100};
```

---
## Determining The Channel

We need to determine the channel we want to do the sweep on, which in our case will be the Grabber channel. 

To determine this, Unreal identifies in code the channels with the names ECC_GameTraceChannel**N** where N is the number of the channel in a list (starting from 1).

To determine where we are in the list we can either go to the collision properties page and count down.

![[Determining The Game Trace Channel From Properties.png]]

Alternatively, can open **DefaultEngine.ini** and search for our Grabber channel.

Either way we find that our channel is called **ECC_GameTraceChannel2**

## Performing The Sweep

We can go ahead and perform the sweep with the following code in our TickComponent method.

```cpp
FHitResult HitResult{ };
FQuat Rotation{ FQuat::Identity };
const FCollisionShape CollisionShape{ FCollisionShape::MakeSphere(GrabRadius) };
World->SweepSingleByChannel(HitResult, Start, End, Rotation, ECC_GameTraceChannel2, CollisionShape);
```

The Start and End were created [[13. Grab Distance And Debug Lines#Drawing The Line|previously]].

---
## Print Out Hit Actor

If we hit something then we should go ahead and print out the name of that actor that was hit, otherwise we can print "No Hit".

```cpp
if (const AActor* const HitActor{ HitResult.GetActor() })
{
	UE_LOGFMT(LogTemp, Log, "Hit Actor: {0}", HitActor->GetActorNameOrLabel());
}
else
{
	UE_LOGFMT(LogTemp, Log, "No Hit");
}
```

---
## Result

If we compile and run this now we can see that we get "No Hit" logged to the console mostly, but when we look at and come in range of the statue, we get the name printed out.
