In the [[8. Moving Platform Child Blueprint Classes|previous]] section, we ended up with a moving platform that was actually a moving pillar that raised and lowered. We'll now get a cube that moves side to side to push the player off.

## The Child Blueprint Class

Just as we did in the previous section, we can easily make a child class of our MovingPlatform class and change the visuals/properties.

After setting up this new child class it should look something like this.

## Pusher Cube In Action

We can dump it into the level and see it acting as we expect here, moving left and right rather than up and down.

## A Collision Issue

There is an issue here with this pushing cube at the moment though, and the interaction with the character controller we're using.

As long as the player is moving, the character controller will behave correctly with respect to any collisions it encounters.

However if the character is not moving then the collision isn't correctly resolved and this happens.

## Fixing The Issue

A proper fix would most likely require delving into the internals of the character controller in order to fix how it reacts to collisions.

However as mentioned [[9. Pusher Cube#A Collision Issue|above]] the collisions are resolved so long as the character is moving. So a quick and hacky fix is to make sure that every frame we move the character slightly, and immediately put them back.

We can do this in the blueprint event graph for our **BP_ThirdPersonCharacter**.

We don't notice this slight movement at all because we're undoing it immediately afterwards, however it's enough to flag internally that the character is moving.

If we look in the level now, the issue is fixed.
