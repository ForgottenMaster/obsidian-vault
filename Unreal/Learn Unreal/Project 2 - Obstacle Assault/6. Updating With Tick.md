Next we can try making a platform that moves over time with a given speed. But first we need to scale the cube to make a platform.

## Scaling Cube

Let's scale the cube to start with to make it more platform shaped for the player to jump onto.

## Setting Speed

Next we need to be able to specify the speed of the platform. We'll move it along the green Y axis based on this speed.

Adding the following code to the script and recompiling will give us the ability to specify the speed of the platform.

```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)
float Speed{100};
```

---
## Updating

Next we can go ahead and implement our update function. In Unreal this is called **Tick** and we are provided the time elapsed since last frame.

The code we want to move the platform along its green (right) axis is shown below.

```cpp
void AMovingPlatform::Tick(float DeltaTime)
{
	Super::Tick(DeltaTime);
	const FVector forwardVector{ GetActorRightVector() };
	const FVector location{ GetActorLocation() };
	SetActorLocation(location + forwardVector * DeltaTime * Speed);
}
```

The points of note here are:
- **GetActorRightVector** => Gives us the world-space vector that represents the right axis of the platform (the green axis shown in the gizmos)
- **GetActorLocation** => Gives the world-space location/position for the actor
- **SetActorLocation** => Sets the world-space location/position for the actor

So in our case we get the forward vector we will be translating along, and the current position. The translation amount is calculated by the DeltaTime and Speed.

## Result

Result of this can be shown in the GIF below.
