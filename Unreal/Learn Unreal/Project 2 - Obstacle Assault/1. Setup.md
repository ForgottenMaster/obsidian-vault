There are two asset packs to install for this project that will provide us assets to build the world up from - along with a fully fledge player character.

---
## Getting the Asset Packs

The first asset pack to get is the **Unreal Learning Kit** asset pack which will be the pack containing all the level props etc. required to make this little game.

And secondly the asset pack which will contain the character model to be used in the project. This is called **Stylised Character Kit: Casual 01** and contains a bunch of different skins for the character that we can select between (will do that in the next bit).

## Creating the Project

We don't create the project from scratch but instead the Unreal Learning Kit allows us to create a new project from that kit.

This is found on the Library panel as we know from the previous project.

We need to fill in the details as shown here in the creation dialog.

Note here that the version of Unreal that the kit allows us to create a project for isn't necessarily as upto-date as the version we have. Therefore we have to create a project with the closest version, and update it.

Create this project and then right-click the project file in the explorer to select the upgrade option.

And select the version of Unreal we actually have which in my case was **5.3.2**.

Then go ahead and open the project which will convert and import the assets.

## Cloning the Example Level

When the project is opened, it'll load the LearningKit_Games_Showcase level. We can use this level to build the project on, but we should save a copy first.

Save as **Main** in our custom content folder, and update in the project settings as the start-up project as we did [[10. Geometry Brushes#Setting Main As Start Scene|here]].

## Importing Character

Next we want to add the character from the character asset pack to the level, first we need to import the asset pack into the project.

After it initialises the asset pack and adds it to the project we can open the project back up again.

And drag and drop the **ThirdPersonCharacter** blueprint class into the scene to instantiate it. Currently this is just a basic mannequin but we will skin it next.
