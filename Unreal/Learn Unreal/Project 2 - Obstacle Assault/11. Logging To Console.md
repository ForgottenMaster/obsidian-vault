How does logging to the console work in Unreal? As of Unreal 5.2 we can use the new **UE_LOGFMT** macro to log to the console.

---
## Including The Header

Before we can log to the console we have to include the header file containing the macro. This just boils down to making sure to add the following line to the source file.

```cpp
#include "Logging/StructuredLog.h"
```

---
## Logging With Positional Arguments

The first way the macro can be used is by using positional arguments using a string interpolation format. For example

```cpp
UE_LOGFMT(LogTemp, Warning, "Name: {0}, Value: {1}", SomeName, SomeValue);
```

As a concrete example suppose we want to print the overshoot amount in the MovingPlatform whenever we swap directions - along with the name of the actor.

We can do this in our Tick function.

```cpp
void AMovingPlatform::Tick(float DeltaTime)
{
	Super::Tick(DeltaTime);
	const FVector location{ GetActorLocation() + Velocity * DeltaTime };
	SetActorLocation(location);
	const double Distance{ FVector::Dist(StartLocation, location) };
	if (Distance >= MaxDistance)
	{
		const double Overshoot{ Distance - MaxDistance };
		UE_LOGFMT(LogTemp, Warning, "Name: {0}, Overshoot: {1}", GetName(), Overshoot);
		StartLocation = StartLocation + Velocity.GetSafeNormal() * MaxDistance;
		Velocity = -Velocity;
	}
}
```

**GetName()** will return to us the name of the actor instance we're operating in the context of.

---
## Logging With Named Arguments

An alternative approach is to use named arguments to be interpolated into the string. This is more or less the same, but with a slightly different syntax.

The above UE_LOGFMT call we have in our Tick function for example can be re-written as.

```cpp
UE_LOGFMT(LogTemp, Warning, "Name: {Name}, Overshoot: {Overshoot}", ("Name", GetName()), ("Overshoot", Overshoot));
```

---
## Results

In both cases, whether logging by positional or named arguments, we get the same logging to the console which is displayed thusly as an example.

## Verbosity Levels

The verbosity level that we specify to the UE_LOGFMT macro as the second argument will decide how important the logs are.

The project can be set up to filter log entries below a certain severity by default.

Here's a table of the verbosity levels.
