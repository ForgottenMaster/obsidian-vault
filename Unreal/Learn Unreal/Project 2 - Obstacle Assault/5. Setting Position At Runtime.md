We can take a look at how we set a position at runtime on an actor by creating a property on our MovingPlatform actor, and then when the game starts we will set the actor position to that to show it's working.

## Adding A Vector Property

Firstly we'll add a property to the script for us to define the position to teleport the actor to on startup.

```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)
FVector TargetPosition;
```

**FVector** is Unreal's vector type, and this will show up as follows in the editor. Let's set the target position to something close to where we have our player.

## Setting The Position At Runtime

Next we want to make it so that when we begin gameplay, we set the position of this actor to the target that was defined.

We can do this in the provided **BeginPlay** method that's stubbed out for us in **MovingPlatform.cpp** as shown below.

```cpp
void AMovingPlatform::BeginPlay()
{
	Super::BeginPlay();
	SetActorLocation(TargetPosition);
}
```

Note that we won't see anything because our actor currently doesn't even have a Transform component which this method operates on.

## Adding Something Visual

We want a Transform component to be able to set the position of, but also want something we can see to make sure the position is being set correctly at runtime.

Let's go ahead and add a cube visual to the actor which also adds the required Transform component.

Notice that after adding the cube which also adds the Transform component, that the location is set to the world origin.

## Testing

Remember to recompile!

When the game is run we should see a cube teleported to the target location.
