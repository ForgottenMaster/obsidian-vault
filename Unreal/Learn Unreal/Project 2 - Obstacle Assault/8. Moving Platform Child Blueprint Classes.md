Now that we have a C++ class defining the behaviour of a moving platform that goes back and forth some distance with some speed, we can make a couple of variants in blueprints.

However first, let's tweak the MovablePlatform script slightly.

---
## Tweakable Movement Direction

The [[7. Going Back And Forth|MovablePlatform]] script we currently have uses the built-in right axis of the actor but we want to be able to specify the movement vector really.

Let's change our current **Speed** property to a **Velocity** property.

```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)
FVector Velocity{ 0.0f, 0.0f, 100.0f };
```

Then change the implementation of the Tick method to use the velocity we specify instead of the previous Speed property.

```cpp
void AMovingPlatform::Tick(float DeltaTime)
{
	Super::Tick(DeltaTime);
	const FVector location{ GetActorLocation() + Velocity * DeltaTime };
	SetActorLocation(location);
	if (FVector::Dist(StartLocation, location) >= MaxDistance)
	{
		StartLocation = StartLocation + Velocity.GetSafeNormal() * MaxDistance;
		Velocity = -Velocity;
	}
}
```

The notable changes here are:

1. We use the Velocity here instead of Speed + forward vector
2. We must get the normalized vector from the velocity when calculating the new StartLocation for the reverse trip (so we can get the correct distance along that vector)
3. We need to negate the Velocity vector itself

## Making A Child Blueprint Class

It's easy enough to do this in Unreal, we can right-click on a C++ class the same as we do with a Blueprint class and choose to make a child blueprint class from it as shown.

After we select this, we get presented with the dialog and we can fill it in appropriately.

## Adding Visuals And Editing Properties

For this moving pillar type of obstacle, we will make it raise and lower from the ground. We also add visuals to make it look like a pillar.

Any visual assets can be used, but for this test just composing it from pieces from the asset kit is good enough.

We set the velocity to move at a speed of 300 units per second in the **Z** direction (up). Setting the max distance to 800 units seems to make it raise to full height before lowering again.

## Result

We can now go ahead and add a few instances into the level and tweak their velocities so some of them move faster than others as a demonstration. This isn't the final level but it is sort of indicative.
