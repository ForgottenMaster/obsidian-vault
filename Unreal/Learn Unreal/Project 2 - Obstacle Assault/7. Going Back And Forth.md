We can slightly modify the updating code from [[6. Updating With Tick|here]] so that instead of progressing in one direction indefinitely, the platform will only move a certain distance from its starting location and then reverse to go back the other way.

---
## Adding The Fields

Along with the speed property we have, we will need to be able to specify the distance that the platform should travel before turning back again.

```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)
float MaxDistance{ 100.0f };
```

This is the only other exposed property we actually need, however we do need some fields that are used at runtime but not exposed to the editor

```cpp
FVector StartLocation;
bool MovingForward;
```

They should be obvious what they're for but as a quick summary

- **StartLocation** => This is used to store at start-up the initial location of the platform so that we can determine how far it's travelled
- **MovingForward** => We will use this to determine if we're moving forward or backward along the movement vector

## Stashing StartLocation

The first thing we will need to do is when we start the game, we need to get the initial location of the platform and store it into the StartLocation field we made.

This is straightforward enough and needs to be done in BeginPlay

```cpp
void AMovingPlatform::BeginPlay()
{
	Super::BeginPlay();
	StartLocation = GetActorLocation();
}
```

---
## Changing Update Logic

Next we just need to change the logic in our Tick function. We will need to do a few things.

The first thing to do is that the forward vector direction will be dependant on whether we are travelling forward or backwards.

```cpp
const FVector forwardVector{ MovingForward ? GetActorRightVector() : -GetActorRightVector() };
```

The updating and setting of the current location stays the same

```cpp
const FVector location{ GetActorLocation() + forwardVector * DeltaTime * Speed };
SetActorLocation(location);
```

Once we've updated the location, we need to be able to check how far we have travelled so we can see if we need to reverse direction or not.

We can do this in Unreal with the **FVector::Dist** function that takes two FVector variables and calculates the distance between them.

In the case that this distance is greater or equal to the max distance we want to go we can do stuff. This conditional is therefore

```cpp
if (FVector::Dist(StartLocation, location) >= MaxDistance)
{
	// do stuff
}
```

What do we need to do?

We need to:

1. Set the StartLocation now to be at the end of the track. This is the position at MaxDistance from the current StartLocation, along the forward vector.
2. Flip the MovingForward bool so we start moving in the other direction

As code this is

```cpp
StartLocation = StartLocation + forwardVector * MaxDistance;
MovingForward = !MovingForward;
```

For visibility, here's the entire Tick function after being updated

```cpp
void AMovingPlatform::Tick(float DeltaTime)
{
	Super::Tick(DeltaTime);
	const FVector forwardVector{ MovingForward ? GetActorRightVector() : -GetActorRightVector() };
	const FVector location{ GetActorLocation() + forwardVector * DeltaTime * Speed };
	SetActorLocation(location);
	if (FVector::Dist(StartLocation, location) >= MaxDistance)
	{
		StartLocation = StartLocation + forwardVector * MaxDistance;
		MovingForward = !MovingForward;
	}
}
```

## Results

After making these changes we can see that in the editor the platform now moves back and forth by 100 units each direction.
