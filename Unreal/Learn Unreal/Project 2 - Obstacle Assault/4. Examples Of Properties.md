In order to expose things to the editor, we can go ahead and add properties to our scripts.

Firstly let's take a quick look at how to add properties with a few examples, but we won't add anything useful just yet. This is also a sanity check of whether our setup works.

## Adding a Property

First thing we want to do is to open up the **MovingPlatform.h** file that we created in the [[3. Compiling C++|previous section]] and we can go ahead and add a property such as a float with the following code.

```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)
float SomeFloat{ 42.5f };
```

In order to have the change displayed in Unreal we would need to either recompile the solution and restart the editor, or we can use the live coding/hot reload functionality within the editor.

Click this button in the editor (at the bottom right of the screen).

It should pop a window up and if all goes well, a notification will tell you that the patching was successful.

Now when we look at an instance of the MovingPlatform actor in the editor, we can see the new property!

## Adding More Properties

Next we can go ahead and add additional example properties to show that all different data types are supported. The following code...

```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)
int SomeInt{ 42 };

UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)
bool SomeBool{ true };
```

Will result in the following in the editor. Notice that the bool is displayed automatically as a checkbox by Unreal.
