Before we can use C++ with Unreal engine, we need a couple of dependencies.

---
## Installing Visual Studio

First thing will be to go and install [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community) which should auto-detect your platform and can click the big download button to install the latest version.

Run the installer and when you get the window to select the workloads to use we will need to choose the **Game development with C++** option. Also need to enable the additional **Unreal Engine installer** module.

We now need to tell Unreal which version of Visual Studio to use as our editor. We can do this by going to the **editor preferences**.

![[Editor Preferences Option In Edit Menu.png]]

Once we've opened the preferences we can go to the Source Code section and pick the version of Visual Studio we are using (VS 2022). We then need to restart the editor so it picks up the changes.

## Adding A C++ Class

Once VS is installed, Unreal allows us to add a new C++ class via the editor.

Let's go ahead and fill out the name to say we want a new **MovingPlatform** class which will be used for.....well, our moving platforms!

We want these platforms to be a kind of actor so we can move them around and such in the world though.

Then we can fill in the name of the class to be created which will automatically fill out the paths to the header and cpp files that will be generated.

Then click the big blue "Create Class" button which will add the sources to the project.

## The Refresh Project Button

Whenever we add/remove/move a C++ class we will need to refresh the visual studio solution with this option.

## Opening The Project

We can open the Visual Studio 2022 solution with the option there in the editor.

## Installing Additional Dependencies

Upon first opening the solution, we are told we probably want to install more dependencies. We should click this option and do as they say.

![[Installing Additional Components For Unreal.png]]

On the following screen it's already populated with the components we need, so we can go ahead and click install.

Once it's installed we should be good to go!

If we want to rebuild the solution, we should rebuild the **DevelopmentEngine** configuration.
