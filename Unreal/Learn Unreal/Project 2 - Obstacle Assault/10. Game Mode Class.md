In Unreal we have access to something called the **GameMode** type. This is a type that defines the settings relating to a project or level such as which pawn to spawn etc.

## Unsetting The Existing GameMode

First we want to go ahead and unset the level override which we can do fairly easily here.

## Creating A New GameMode

We'll go ahead and create a brand new GameMode for the project. We can pick whatever base class we'd like but here we'll just use **GameModeBase**

This will bring up a nice dialog for us, which we'll be used to by now! Go ahead and name it something sensible.

## Editing The GameMode

We don't need to do too much at the moment with this new GameMode, but what we do need to do is to tell it what pawn we will be spawning for the player to possess.

## Adding PlayerStart Into The World

Currently we have an actual character instance just in the world but what we want to do is to replace this with a spawner.

Let's add this into the world instead of the character itself.

Firstly we need to open up the panel which can be found on the window menu.

We can then drag and drop the **Player Start** actor into the world and delete our pre-placed character.

## Result

After this we can see that when we start running the game, Unreal spawns the default pawn (which we set to be BP_ThirdPersonCharacter) into the location indicated by our PlayerStart actor.

However, we are also able to right-click anywhere in the world and start playing from that point instead by using this option Unreal gives to us.
