We have a platform that just goes back and forth, or up and down which is a good start. However let's look at how we can rotate stuff in Unreal.

## Property Categories

The first thing to quickly cover is that when we define a UPROPERTY of an actor, we are able to specify (along with flags like EditAnywhere) a category which can be used to group things up in the details panel in the editor.

As an example, let's put both of the existing properties under a **Translation** category.

```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category="Translation")
FVector Velocity{ 0.0f, 0.0f, 100.0f };

UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category="Translation")
float MaxDistance{ 100.0f };
```

These are then displayed in the editor under a Translation heading that can be folded/unfolded to show or hide these properties.

## The FRotator

Unreal represents a rotation using a type called **FRotator** which hides the implementation details of whether it's using a quaternion, Euler angles, etc.

We can make a UPROPERTY to use this to define the angular velocity of an actor.

```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category="Rotation")
FRotator AngularVelocity{ 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f };
```

This will then show up in the editor as expected. It looks like it has the same fields as FVector and it does, except these represent the angles around the axes (in degrees).

## Rotating In Code

We can go ahead and add this to our MovablePlatform::Tick method. This will add the given amount of rotation to the actor, in local space.

```cpp
AddActorLocalRotation(AngularVelocity * DeltaTime);
```

---
## Making A Rotating Platform

We can go ahead and make a new blueprint class deriving from MovablePlatform, and set it up so it rotates instead of moving.

This is simple enough to set up so here it is!

Although one thing to note is that I've scaled the platform from the asset kit to be 5 times larger.

## Result

When we click to run the game we can see the platform rotating around at our defined speed of 180 degrees per second.
