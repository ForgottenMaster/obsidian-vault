This section will be running through how to add the **ThirdPersonCharacter** player character to the project. First of all we have a bug to fix.

## Fixing The Character

There is a bug with the character as it comes where it's using inputs that aren't set up for this project. This means that the camera can't be rotated left and right. Taking a look at the ThirdPersonCharacter blueprint we can see the two nodes with warnings, and the console tells us what the warnings are about.

To fix these we simply need to replace the nodes with different ones as shown here.

**TIP:** Holding down CTRL and dragging from a socket will drag all connections to the socket, allowing us to easily re-bind the connections from the broken node to the new one.

## Adding A Character Into The Scene

Next we can simply drag-and-drop the ThirdPersonCharacter blueprint into the scene to the desired location to spawn an instance of it as shown here!

We do need to remove the PlayerSpawner that's already in the scene as well - so we can go ahead and remove that.

Finally - in lieu of the player spawner no longer being present. We can tell Unreal to automatically be possessed by the player.

In the ThirdPersonCharacter blueprint we can set this setting.

## Changing Character Skin

We have the character set up now, but will want it to look different.

Firstly create a **blueprint child class** by clicking the ThirdPersonCharacter instance and selecting this option.

When the dialog appears, it can be set up with the following options to create a child blueprint class - this also automatically replaces the instance in the scene to instance the new child blueprint.

In the resulting blueprint we can locate the skeletal mesh asset and select the drop-down in order to pick a new mesh.

## Result

After setting up the character and swapping the skin we can enter play mode to ensure everything works and we have both camera movement with the mouse and WASD movement of the character.
