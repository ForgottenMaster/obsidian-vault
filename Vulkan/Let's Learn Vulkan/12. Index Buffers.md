Currently, we are rendering a multi-color square as two triangles. However, two of the vertices are shared between both triangles and currently we have to duplicate **all** the vertex data for those shared vertices.

Using an index buffer allows us to only duplicate *indices* which then index into the vertex buffer for the actual data. An index may only be 2 bytes and so duplicating that as opposed to duplicating N bytes of vertex data results in large savings.

The diagram below shows the difference between direct drawing from vertex data only, and indexed drawing using an index buffer.

![[Vertex Buffer Only Vs With Index Buffer.png]]

The implementation is actually super simple and we'll only have to do three things:
1. Create the index buffer
2. Bind the index buffer before the draw call
3. Use indexed draw rather than direct draw

# Creating the Index Buffer #

Thanks to the generic **create_staged_buffer** function we implemented for staged vertex buffers, creating an index buffer is equally as easy. The only difference is that our indices are u16's and that the resulting buffer must be identified as being an **INDEX_BUFFER**

```rust
fn create_index_buffer(
    instance: &Instance,
    device: &Device,
    physical_device: PhysicalDevice,
    indices: &[u16],
    transfer_command_pool: CommandPool,
    transfer_queue: Queue,
) -> Result<(Buffer, DeviceMemory)> {
    create_staged_buffer(
        instance,
        device,
        physical_device,
        indices,
        BufferUsageFlags::INDEX_BUFFER,
        transfer_command_pool,
        transfer_queue,
    )
    .context("Failed to create an index buffer.")
}
```

# Bind the Index Buffer #

Unlike vertex buffers, Vulkan only supports binding a single index buffer. As part of binding the buffer we have to tell Vulkan just how it should interpret the indices, and in our case we use u16's. Note that if we had more than 65.5k *unique* vertices in the draw call, we would need to use a larger type for our indices.

To bind the index buffer we use the appropriate command while recording our drawing commands, just before the draw itself.

```rust
device.cmd_bind_index_buffer(*command_buffer, index_buffer, 0, IndexType::UINT16);
```

---
# Use Indexed Draw #

Finally we can go ahead and change the draw to an indexed draw. This takes the instance count and offsets as before but we'll keep the instance count at 1 and offsets at 0.

```rust
device.cmd_draw_indexed(*command_buffer, index_count.try_into().unwrap(), 1, 0, 0, 0);
```

Once again, running the program gives us that same familiar multi-color square without any Vulkan errors, letting us know that we have successfully implemented our index buffer.
