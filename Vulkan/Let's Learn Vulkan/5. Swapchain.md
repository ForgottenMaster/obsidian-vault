Now that we've been able to create the device surface, and get appropriate information about what formats, colour spaces, and presentation modes are available, we are ready to tackle the next step in setting up a rendering environment. This next step will be what's called a **swapchain**

---
# What is screen tearing? #

On the front-end side of things, the device surface represents the rendering context and can be considered "the window" for our purposes. The surface is only able to show one buffer of data at a time, and that buffer is submitted to it by the Vulkan API.

However on the back-end side of things, we won't render directly into the surface, but instead will render into an image and then **submit** that image to the surface for presentation.

However, if we were to submit directly the image after we've finished rendering with it, then the device could be halfway through rendering the previous image and will just continue reading the rest from the new image, resulting in a half-old, half-new render as illustrated below

![Screen Tearing](Screen%20Tearing.jpg)

Therefore we would ideally like to render to a *different* image while the previous one is being presented, and to have the new one presented at an appropriate time.

---
# What is a swap chain? #

A swap chain handles for us a queue of images, and provides a way to give us the image to which we are supposed to render to, before submitting it back to the chain and getting another one. In effect it handles us *swapping* through the images we'll be rendering to.

It also handles synchronization with the surface for presenting the next image to the surface either immediately, or during the vertical blank depending on the presentation mode.

The swap chain can be visualised with the following image

![Swap Chain](Swapchain%20Overview.png)

---
# Presentation modes #

The swap chain is generally a queue of images as mentioned, and handles coordination with the presentation engine either waiting for, or not waiting for a vertical blank.

There are 4 main presentation modes we can use - 2 of which **may** result in screen tearing because they update the presented image in the middle of presenting the previous image. These 4 modes are:

- **Immediate**: This mode causes the swapchain to have no internal queue of images. It will take the image to be presented and immediately update it in the presentation engine, resulting in potential screen tearing.
- **Mailbox**: This mode causes the swapchain to have an internal buffer of one image. When receiving the submitted image from the application, the swapchain will hold onto it until the next vertical blank, at which point it presents it to the presentation engine. No screen tearing can occur here because the swapchain always waits for a vertical blank before presenting the new image. If another image is given to the swapchain in the meantime, it just updates the one it's holding.
- **FIFO**: This mode also cannot result in screen tearing because the images in the queue are all presented during a vertical blank. The difference between this and mailbox is that with mailbox, if a new image is submitted by the application before an old one is presented, the old on is never presented. In FIFO, all submitted images are presented. This means that the application may end up waiting for a free image as all are stuck in the queue. Note that this presentation mode is **required** to be supported by the Vulkan spec.
- **FIFO Relaxed**: This is similar to FIFO except that the swapchain submits a new image in the queue to the presentation engine when it's submitted by the application. It recognizes that the view on the surface is stale, and it's getting a new incoming image from the application so it presents it immediately - can result in screen tearing.

# Choosing the best colour format #

The first thing we need to do is to look at the colour formats that are available to the surface we've constructed, and choose one of them with which to construct our swap chain.

A colour format is actually constructed from 2 pieces of information:
1. The actual format, which describes how many bytes/bits per pixel there are in the images of the swapchain, and how those bits are interpreted.
2. The colour space, which describes a colour palette of sorts and how to map the bytes in the image to colours.

The most common colour format is going to be **R8G8B8A8_UNORM** which will be a standard 1-byte-per-channel, normalised RGBA pixel. This will be the one we'll try to go for in fact, and as a fall-back if that isn't found we'll look at BGRA which is more or less the same but with the R and B channels flipped.

For colour space, the most common is **SRGB_NONLINEAR**.

We'll create an accessor function on our SurfaceInfo struct that can search for the best format for us to use and return it. The signature will look like

```rust
fn choose_best_color_format(&self) -> SurfaceFormatKHR
```

Within the function we'll define the desired format (and alt format), along with the desired colour space

```rust
const DESIRED_FORMAT: Format = Format::R8G8B8A8_UNORM;
const DESIRED_FORMAT_ALT: Format = Format::B8G8R8A8_UNORM;
const DESIRED_COLOR_SPACE: ColorSpaceKHR = ColorSpaceKHR::SRGB_NONLINEAR;
```

Vulkan has a shorthand method of reporting that **all** formats are supported in fact, which is to report only a single format, with type UNIDENTIFIED. If we get this, then we know the device supports any and all format/colour space combinations so we can ask for our desired one

```rust
if self.surface_formats.len() == 1 && self.surface_formats[0].format == Format::UNDEFINED {
    SurfaceFormatKHR {
        format: DESIRED_FORMAT,
        color_space: DESIRED_COLOR_SPACE
    }
} else {
    // calculate other branch
}
```

If not, then we can look through the supported formats list, and try to find one that matches our desired formats/colour space

```rust
for format in &self.surface_formats {
    if (format.format == DESIRED_FORMAT || format.format == DESIRED_FORMAT_ALT)
        && format.color_space == DESIRED_COLOR_SPACE
    {
        return *format;
    }
}
```

If we manage to get through the entire list without finding a match then we can just go ahead and return the very first supported format arbitrarily as a backup

```rust
self.surface_formats[0]
```

---
# Choosing the best presentation mode #

As mentioned previously - 2 of the presentation modes don't introduce screen tearing, at the cost of a little latency in the display. Furthermore mailbox introduces no overhead of waiting for a free image for the application to continue rendering because new images just replace the existing one in the mailbox.

Since we don't want screen tearing, and don't care about every single frame being displayed we'll use mailbox if it's available.

If not, luckily the Vulkan spec guarantees that FIFO is available so we use that. The function then in its entirety is pretty simple

```rust
fn choose_best_present_mode(&self) -> PresentModeKHR {
    const DESIRED_MODE: PresentModeKHR = PresentModeKHR::MAILBOX;
    if self.present_modes.contains(&DESIRED_MODE) {
        DESIRED_MODE
    } else {
        PresentModeKHR::FIFO
    }
}
```

---
# Choosing swapchain extents #

The final thing we need to do is to get the size of the images that the swapchain will make for us.

Vulkan may have gotten the current image size from the window handles that were used to create the surface and so if the current_extent is set in our surface capabilities, we can use that.

However, in the case that the image size is controllable by us, Vulkan sets width/height to be u32::MAX and in that case we'll need to calculate it ourselves.

The signature of this function then shows that we need to accept the window in case we do need to look up the size of the surface

```rust
fn choose_swapchain_extents(&self, window: &Window) -> Extent2D 
```

So, we first check if the width is set to anything other than u32::MAX

```rust
let current_extent = self.surface_capabilities.current_extent;
if current_extent.width != u32::MAX {
    current_extent
} else {
    // need to calculate it ourselves
}
```

In the case that we need to calculate ourselves we can get the width/height of the images we need to make from the window by using the **inner_size** function.

We may need to clamp the width/height to the min and max supported values though just in case (although, I can't think of how the window itself is able to present anything higher than Vulkan itself supports...)

The code for the path where we calculate it ourselves then looks as follows

```rust
let window_size = window.inner_size();
let (width, height) = (window_size.width, window_size.height);
let (min_width, min_height) = (
    self.surface_capabilities.min_image_extent.width,
    self.surface_capabilities.min_image_extent.height,
);
let (max_width, max_height) = (
    self.surface_capabilities.max_image_extent.width,
    self.surface_capabilities.max_image_extent.height,
);
let width = cmp::min(cmp::max(width, min_width), max_width);
let height = cmp::min(cmp::max(height, min_height), max_height);
Extent2D { width, height }
```

---
# Creating the swapchain #

Now that we have the helpers to get the best colour format, colour space, and present mode, along with the other capabilities for the surface, we can go ahead and create the swap chain we'll be using.

We'll go ahead and define a create_swapchain function we can use that will have the following signature

```rust
fn create_swapchain(
    swapchain_ext: &Swapchain,
    surface: SurfaceKHR,
    surface_info: &SurfaceInfo,
    queue_family_indices: &QueueFamilyIndices,
    window: &Window,
) -> Result<SwapchainKHR>
```

We need the information for the following purposes:
- **swapchain_ext** - Ash bundles all the extension functions into a type with the same name as the extension. Specifically, we need this to access the create_swapchain function
- **surface** - Swapchain creation requires a handle to the surface
- **surface_info** - We get the capabilities, and best present mode, and format from this
- **queue_family_indices** - We need these for setting up the swapchain either as a concurrent, or exclusive chain depending on if the graphics and present families are the same or different
- **window** - This is required when getting the extents because if the extents aren't already encoded in the surface info, we need to get them from the window

The first thing we need is to work out how many images we need to make. In order for presentation to work correctly, the surface is able to require a lower bound minimum number of images we need in the chain, however to give us a bit of leeway and implement triple buffering, we'll try to add one on to the minimum required.

However the surface also dictates an upper bound maximum number of images that can be used, so we need to clamp to this min/max range

```rust
let min_image_count = cmp::min(
    surface_info.surface_capabilities.max_image_count,
    surface_info.surface_capabilities.min_image_count + 1,
);
```

We get the best format and shove that into a variable, because the builder for the swapchain creation info actually takes both parts of the format individually and we don't want to call choose_best_color_format twice

```rust
let best_format = surface_info.choose_best_color_format();
```

In order to determine if this swapchain requires multiple families to be able to access the images at the same time (and thus introducing additional synchronization overhead), we need to look at the graphics and present families we found. If they are the same, we don't need concurrent access. If they're different then we do!

```rust
let queue_family_indices = [
    queue_family_indices.graphics_family.unwrap(),
    queue_family_indices.presentation_family.unwrap(),
];
let is_concurrent = queue_family_indices[0] != queue_family_indices[1];
```

The bulk of the builder setup here is common

```rust
let create_info = SwapchainCreateInfoKHR::builder()
    .surface(surface)
    .min_image_count(min_image_count)
    .image_format(best_format.format)
    .image_color_space(best_format.color_space)
    .image_extent(surface_info.choose_swapchain_extents(window))
    .image_array_layers(1)
    .image_usage(ImageUsageFlags::COLOR_ATTACHMENT)
    .pre_transform(surface_info.surface_capabilities.current_transform)
    .composite_alpha(CompositeAlphaFlagsKHR::OPAQUE)
    .present_mode(surface_info.choose_best_present_mode())
    .clipped(true);
```

A few notes on the new parameters though:
- **image_array_layers**: Each image in the chain can have multiple layers, however we only use 1 layer per image so this is set to 1
- **image_usage**: We need to tell Vulkan how the images are going to be used. In our case we use them to render color attachments into
- **pre_transform**: A transform that's applied to the images before being presented. We just get this from the surface capabilities directly
- **composite_alpha**: This is the behaviour we want for when the surface is partially occluded with another window. In our case we don't want any blending so just set to opaque
- **clipped**: This is whether we still want to draw to portions of the surface hidden behind other windows for example. In our case we want to clip them so it doesn't bother trying to draw occluded portions

Next we can finish off setting up the builder by specifying either concurrent or exclusive image access mode. If concurrent mode then we need to pass along the indices of the families that are allowed to access it

```rust
let create_info = if is_concurrent {
    create_info
        .image_sharing_mode(SharingMode::CONCURRENT)
        .queue_family_indices(&queue_family_indices)
} else {
    create_info.image_sharing_mode(SharingMode::EXCLUSIVE)
};
```

Finally, we can just call create_swapchain and pass the builder through

```rust
swapchain_ext
    .create_swapchain(&create_info, None)
    .context("Error while creating a swapchain.")
```

---
# Destroying a swapchain #

We have to remember to destroy the swapchain once it's not in use anymore, which we'll do by passing to the clean-up function to consume and destroy. We also need to pass the object used to access the extension function pointers so we can access the destroy_swapchain function.

We make sure the swapchain is destroyed before the logical device also. The cleanup function then looks like this now

```rust
fn cleanup(
    instance: Instance,
    device: Device,
    debug_utils: DebugUtils,
    messenger: DebugUtilsMessengerEXT,
    surface_ext: Surface,
    surface: SurfaceKHR,
    swapchain_ext: Swapchain,
    swapchain: SwapchainKHR,
) {
    unsafe {
        swapchain_ext.destroy_swapchain(swapchain, None);
        device.destroy_device(None);
        debug_utils.destroy_debug_utils_messenger(messenger, None);
        surface_ext.destroy_surface(surface, None);
        instance.destroy_instance(None);
    }
}
```

---
# Creating the image views #

After creating the swapchain and getting a handle to it, Vulkan will have set it up to create the images for use by the swapchain. However, much like when we created our logical device and didn't get back the queue handles automatically, we need to query for the swapchain image handles now.

However, we *also* need to create image *views* for each image because we don't submit draw operations directly to the images but to these views which we must create and destroy manually.

We'll first create a struct for storing an image and image view pairing

```rust
struct SwapchainImage {
    image: Image,
    image_view: ImageView,
}
```

We'll then create a function that can create the image views and fill out a vector of these pairings for us for later use. This will have the following signature

```rust
fn get_swapchain_images(
    swapchain_ext: &Swapchain,
    swapchain: SwapchainKHR,
    format: Format,
    device: &Device,
) -> Result<Vec<SwapchainImage>>
```

We need the swapchain extension object because it provides us with the function to retrieve the images allocated for a given swapchain. We need the device handle because it provides us the ability to create an image view. We need the format because we need to ensure the image views are created with the same format.

For retrieval of the swapchain image handles themselves, this is just a simple call. We'll also then allocate a Vec\<SwapchainImage\> of the same size for our output

```rust
let swapchain_images = swapchain_ext.get_swapchain_images(swapchain)?;
let mut swapchain_images_output = Vec::with_capacity(swapchain_images.len());
```

We then just need to go through each of the images we've been given and create an image view for it, before wrapping both up into a SwapchainImage to push into the Vec

```rust
for image in swapchain_images {
    let image_view = create_image_view(image, format, ImageAspectFlags::COLOR, device)?;
    swapchain_images_output.push(SwapchainImage { image, image_view })
}
```

Notice that we've delegated the functionality to make an image view to a create_image_view function so it might get reused later.

That function has the following signature

```rust
fn create_image_view(
    image: Image,
    format: Format,
    aspect_flags: ImageAspectFlags,
    device: &Device,
) -> Result<ImageView>
```

Where image is the handle to the image we're making a view for, format is the data format of that image, the aspect flags tell Vulkan which parts of the image the view will use (in the swapchain case it's a colour buffer), and the device is needed for actual view creation.

The first thing we'll need is to make what's called a **component mapping** which tells Vulkan which, if any, swizzling operation to do to a channel when it's accessed. In our case we'll just always use identity, which keeps the data in the channel the same as it should be

```rust
let component_mapping_builder = ComponentMapping::builder()
    .r(ComponentSwizzle::IDENTITY)
    .g(ComponentSwizzle::IDENTITY)
    .b(ComponentSwizzle::IDENTITY)
    .a(ComponentSwizzle::IDENTITY);
```

The second thing we need to make is something to tell Vulkan which parts of the image the view will be using. In our case we're taking the aspect flags in to the function for flexibility. We also need to tell the image view which MIP levels it is caring about, and also which layers of the image.

Since we told the swapchain to only generate 1 layer per image already, then we can just look at that 1 layer. Similarly, we're not generating mips so we just look at the 1 level.

```rust
let subresource_range_builder = ImageSubresourceRange::builder()
    .aspect_mask(aspect_flags)
    .base_mip_level(0)
    .level_count(1)
    .base_array_layer(0)
    .layer_count(1);
```

Finally we can make the creation parameters. We'll hard code these image views to be 2D images

```rust
let builder = ImageViewCreateInfo::builder()
    .image(image)
    .view_type(ImageViewType::TYPE_2D)
    .format(format)
    .components(*component_mapping_builder)
    .subresource_range(*subresource_range_builder);
```

Finally!, we can tell Vulkan to make the image view for us

```rust
unsafe { device.create_image_view(&builder, None) }
        .context("Error while trying to create an image view.")
```

---
# Destroying image views #

Since image views were something we manually asked Vulkan to make for us, we also need to manually ask Vulkan to destroy them for us.

We'll modify the clean-up function to accept **Vec\<SwapchainImage\>** to destroy, and add this loop into the function body, destroying the image views before we destroy the swapchain (since destroying swapchain takes the images with it).

```rust
for swapchain_image in swapchain_images {
    device.destroy_image_view(swapchain_image.image_view, None);
}
```
