Currently although we are defining the 4 vertices of a **square** what we actually have is a rectangle due to the scaling of the window. This is more obvious on windows that are much wider, or taller than the other dimension. As an example let's take a look at our current implementation in a window with a width of 1200 and a height of only 600

![Stretched](Stretched%20Incorrect%20Quad.png)

---
# Solution #

In order to solve this issue we will need to transform the vertices in our vertex shader by a model-view-projection trio of matrices. Definitions for these are as follows:
- **model**: This matrix transforms the model itself such as scaling it, moving, or rotating it in world space.
- **view**: This defines the positioning and orientation of the camera that is viewing the scene.
- **projection**: This matrix defines how the world space coordinates are projected into screen space.

The big question is how do we get these matrices from our application into the shader to be used? The answer here is **Uniform Buffer Objects**.

---
# Adding Definitions #

In order to use UBO's in Vulkan, we must first define the structure of the object on the application side, as well as the shader side. However first we will need to install a new dependency.

#### Installing Glam ####

We don't want to reinvent the wheel when it comes to matrix maths, and there are several crates which contain types compatible with the shader equivalents so that the buffer of data on the application side matches up with what the shader expects.

We'll install a crate called glam which is as simple as adding this to our Cargo.toml

```toml
glam = "0.23.0"
```

#### Defining the UBO Application Side ####

We can define our UBO structure on the application side fairly easily now that we've installed glam since it contains types matching up with the shader types. Putting these into a struct with "C" representation will result in the same layout.

In this case, the three entries are 4-D matrices which in GLSL is **mat4**. Similarly in glam, it's **Mat4** so the structure looks as follows

```rust
#[repr(C)]
struct ModelViewProjection {
    projection: Mat4,
    view: Mat4,
    model: Mat4,
}
```

#### Defining the UBO Shader Side ####

We can then go ahead and define the UBO with the **same structure** in our Vertex shader. 

```glsl
layout(binding = 0) uniform MVP {
    mat4 projection;
    mat4 view;
    mat4 model;
} mvp;
```

Notice here that we must specify a layout and must tell it that this UBO is at binding 0. We can also have different **descriptor sets** which we'll encounter soon, and here there's an implicit "set = 0" in the layout, but we can leave it off here.

Notice also the keyword **uniform** which means this data will be constant over the whole draw call and not vary per-vertex like attributes do.

#### Using the UBO ####

Now we can alter the vertex shader to actually use the UBO data. This is simple, we will take the calculated vertex position (in model/local space) and apply in order the **model**, **view**, and **projection** matrices as so

```glsl
gl_Position = mvp.projection * mvp.view * mvp.model * vec4(position, 1.0);
```

---
# Descriptors Overview #

Next we need to consider *how* we get data hooked up to the graphics pipeline so that it can be passed over to the Vertex shader. Vulkan uses something known as **descriptor sets** for this type of data, of which uniform buffers are only one kind.

There are a few different types that interplay here but as a visual overview we can look to this diagram

![[Descriptor Set Overview.png]]

Over the next few sections I'll go over these types and setting them up to get our data into a uniform buffer and connected up to the pipeline.

---
# Descriptor Set Layout #

The first step is to tell the pipeline the *layout* of our descriptor sets. This can be thought of as defining the shape of the descriptor sets, as it's used to create the pipeline layout, and the actual descriptor sets matching this shape are bound before using the pipeline to draw.

First step then is to create this descriptor set layout. Like the PipelineLayout, Vulkan expects us to create this separately (and destroy separately) before we go ahead and use it to construct one or more pipeline layouts. We'll do this in a create_descriptor_set_layout function.

```rust
fn create_descriptor_set_layout(device: &Device) -> Result<DescriptorSetLayout> {
    unsafe {
        device
            .create_descriptor_set_layout(
                &DescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo::builder().bindings(&[
                    *DescriptorSetLayoutBinding::builder()
                        .descriptor_type(DescriptorType::UNIFORM_BUFFER)
                        .descriptor_count(1)
                        .stage_flags(ShaderStageFlags::VERTEX),
                ]),
                None,
            )
            .context("Failed to create a descriptor set layout.")
    }
}
```

We can pass multiple **bindings** as mentioned into the builder when constructing a layout for a single descriptor set. The index of the binding in the list corresponds with the "binding" number in our vertex shader. In this case we only have a single binding at index 0 and that is indeed what the vertex shader looks at when mapping the UBO.

We are only creating a single descriptor within this set, and the type of this descriptor is a **UNIFORM_BUFFER**. We must specify which stage of the pipeline we'll be binding the descriptors to, and in this case the vertex shader uses the data, so it gets bound to ShaderStageFlags::**VERTEX**.

Once we've constructed this, we need to go ahead and pass it in to our pipeline layout also

```rust
fn create_pipeline_layout(
    device: &Device,
    set_layouts: &[DescriptorSetLayout],
) -> Result<PipelineLayout> {
    unsafe {
        device.create_pipeline_layout(
            &PipelineLayoutCreateInfo::builder()
                .set_layouts(set_layouts)
                .push_constant_ranges(&[]),
            None,
        )
    }
    .context("Error trying to create a pipeline layout.")
}
```

Notice that we can pass multiple sets also, which corresponds to the "set" number in the layout within our vertex shader. set=0 is the default and is what we're using, which corresponds to the descriptor set at index 0.

---
# Uniform Buffers #

Next we can go ahead and allocate the buffers and backing memory for our uniform data. We need to create one buffer **per swapchain image** because we don't want the application to be updating the uniform data within the buffer while it's still being rendered.

Therefore we make our create_uniform_buffer**s** function, and pass the number to create in.

```rust
fn create_uniform_buffers(
    instance: &Instance,
    device: &Device,
    physical_device: PhysicalDevice,
    count: usize,
) -> Result<Vec<(Buffer, DeviceMemory)>> {
    let mut buffers = Vec::with_capacity(count);
    for _ in 0..count {
        buffers.push(
            create_buffer(
                instance,
                device,
                physical_device,
                BufferUsageFlags::UNIFORM_BUFFER,
                MemoryPropertyFlags::HOST_VISIBLE | MemoryPropertyFlags::HOST_COHERENT,
                mem::size_of::<ModelViewProjection>().try_into().unwrap(),
            )
            .context("Failed to create a uniform buffer.")?,
        );
    }
    Ok(buffers)
}
```

We return a Vec<(Buffer, DeviceMemory)> because we are creating multiple in a loop.

We force the device memory to be **HOST_VISIBLE** and **HOST_COHERENT** because we will be updating this memory every frame potentially as the model/view matrices change due to the model moving in the world, or the camera. There's no point using staging buffer because the overhead of constantly copying to device local memory every frame would not be worth it.

The buffer usage is set to **UNIFORM_BUFFER**, and the size of the buffer wants to be large enough to store a single ModelViewProjection struct in it.

The create_buffer function we wrote earlier will take care of allocating the buffer and memory, and binding the two together!

---
# Allocating Descriptor Sets #

Now that we have told the pipeline what the structure of the descriptor set is that it should expect, and we've allocated our buffers for them we can start working on the actual descriptor set instances.

However, Vulkan doesn't allow us to just create descriptor sets unfortunately. They must be allocated from a **pool** much like command buffers are.

```rust
fn create_descriptor_pool(device: &Device, count: u32) -> Result<DescriptorPool> {
    unsafe {
        device
            .create_descriptor_pool(
                &DescriptorPoolCreateInfo::builder()
                    .max_sets(count)
                    .pool_sizes(&[*DescriptorPoolSize::builder()
                        .ty(DescriptorType::UNIFORM_BUFFER)
                        .descriptor_count(count)]),
                None,
            )
            .context("Failed to create a descriptor pool.")
    }
}
```

In order to create a descriptor pool though, unlike when creating a command buffer pool, we must tell Vulkan the maximum number of different descriptor sets that can be allocated from this pool at any given time. Additionally we need to tell Vulkan the maximum number of individual descriptor types.

In our case, the maximum number of descriptor set instances is the number of swapchain images (passed in via count). Additionally, since we only have a single uniform buffer descriptor per set, then we tell Vulkan to create a number of uniform buffer descriptors in the pool equal to count also.

Next we need to actually **allocate** the descriptor set instances we need from the pool. In our case we will just be draining the pool since we told it to create just enough for our needs.

```rust
fn allocate_descriptor_sets(
    device: &Device,
    descriptor_pool: DescriptorPool,
    descriptor_set_layout: DescriptorSetLayout,
    count: usize,
) -> Result<Vec<DescriptorSet>> {
    let layouts = std::iter::repeat(descriptor_set_layout)
        .take(count)
        .collect::<Vec<_>>();
    unsafe {
        device
            .allocate_descriptor_sets(
                &DescriptorSetAllocateInfo::builder()
                    .descriptor_pool(descriptor_pool)
                    .set_layouts(&layouts),
            )
            .context("Failed to allocate descriptor sets.")
    }
}
```

We pass the DescriptorSetLayout here through to the allocate_descriptor_sets function, along with the pool, and the count of how many.

The way the allocate_descriptor_sets function is setup from Vulkan is that it takes the pool, along with a **slice** of layouts, and will return an instance per layout in the slice in the same order (hence this function returns a Vec\<DescriptorSet>).

We only have one DescriptorSetLayout and want count copies, so we can use the handy iterator functions to create a vector with count copies of the layout with

```rust
let layouts = std::iter::repeat(descriptor_set_layout)
    .take(count)
    .collect::<Vec<_>>();
```

With that, we have allocated the descriptor set instances and are one step closer to using them!

---
# Binding #

There are two kinds of bindings we need to do at this point to make the buffers usable in our shaders
1. Binding the **buffers** to the **descriptor sets**
2. Binding the **descriptor sets** to the **draw call**

Binding the buffers to the descriptor sets is slightly more involved but it's not too bad - it's just that Vulkan has a few different types we need to construct to do the updating.

For this, we'll go ahead and make a function **update_descriptor_sets** with the following signature

```rust
fn update_descriptor_sets(
    device: &Device,
    buffers: &[(Buffer, DeviceMemory)],
    sets: &[DescriptorSet],
)
```

It requires the device to be able to call the update function with, but along with this requires the buffers, and descriptor sets. The function expects these two slices to be the same length and order such that buffers[i] should be bound to sets[i].

The first thing we need to do here is to create the list of **DescriptorBufferInfo**. This is a separate type because our descriptors, as mentioned could be of various types and in this case they are buffers, so we need the buffer infos.

The buffer info has the following information in it
1. The buffer that this descriptor will be bound to
2. The offset within the buffer that the descriptor should be associated with
3. The range within the buffer of the data to be bound to this descriptor

In our case, the offset is 0 (default), and the range is the size of one ModelViewProjection instance.

We will go ahead and create on DescriptorBufferInfo struct for **each** uniform buffer

```rust
let buffer_infos = buffers
    .iter()
    .map(|(buffer, _)| {
        vec![*DescriptorBufferInfo::builder()
            .buffer(*buffer)
            .range(mem::size_of::<ModelViewProjection>().try_into().unwrap())]
    })
    .collect::<Vec<_>>();
```

Notice that we are returning a **Vec**\<DescriptorBufferInfo> for each buffer, this is because the next step will take a Vec of those and each one would be associated with a binding though again we're using only a single buffer per set, so this is just going to be at binding 0 (index 0).

Now we need to go over the buffer infos, and the DescriptorSet instances associated with them, which we can do by zipping them together

```rust
buffer_infos
    .iter()
    .zip(sets)
```

And for each pair, we'll map them to a **WriteDescriptorSet** instance containing the information to write/bind to the descriptor set instance

```rust
.map(|(buffer_info, set)| {
    *WriteDescriptorSet::builder()
        .dst_set(*set)
        .descriptor_type(DescriptorType::UNIFORM_BUFFER)
        .buffer_info(buffer_info)
})
```

We set the descriptor set, along with the descriptor type (UNIFORM_BUFFER), and the list of buffer infos defining all the uniform buffers in the set. We only have one, but it's still a list, we can pass it straight in.

Finally we can go ahead and collect all these WriteDescriptorSet instances into a Vec

```rust
.collect::<Vec<_>>();
```

The last step is to tell Vulkan to actually go ahead and update these descriptor set instances with the appropriate information

```rust
unsafe {
    device.update_descriptor_sets(&writes, &[]);
}
```

There are actually two kinds of updates we can do with descriptor sets. We're only doing **writes** but we could also do **copies** where we copy bindings from one set to another.

That's enough for binding our buffers to our descriptor sets!. Next we just have to bind our descriptor sets to our draw calls. We'll hop on over to where we record our command buffers per frame and add this just before the draw call

```rust
device.cmd_bind_descriptor_sets(
    *command_buffer,
    PipelineBindPoint::GRAPHICS,
    pipeline_layout,
    0,
    &[*descriptor_set],
    &[],
);
```

Here we're saying we want to bind these descriptor sets to the graphics pipeline bind point, with the given pipeline layout, and we're providing the descriptor sets to match the pipeline layout. In this case only a single descriptor set which will be the one associated with the current command buffer.

And....that's all the setup we need! our vertex shader is now reading the UBO, however we need to populate it with something sensible.

---
# Writing Into the UBOs #

We'll handle this by keeping an instance of the ModelViewProjection structure around that we can update during our application as needed. Just before we ask to draw to the appropriate image, we'll copy the data from this single instance into the matching UBO for that frame/image.

Firstly we'll initialise the struct as follows

```rust
let mut mvp = ModelViewProjection {
    model: Mat4::IDENTITY,
    view: Mat4::look_at_rh(
        Vec3::new(0.0, 0.0, 2.0),
        Vec3::new(0.0, 0.0, 0.0),
        Vec3::new(0.0, 1.0, 0.0),
    ),
    projection: Mat4::perspective_rh(45.0_f32.to_radians(), aspect, 0.1, 100.0),
};
```

The explanations are as follows
- **model**: We start off with the model being untranslated, unrotated, and unscaled - the identity matrix
- **view**: We can use the look_at_rh function (OpenGL is a RH coordinate system) to create a camera matrix at coordinate (0, 0, 2) and looking towards the origin, with up being the standard (0, 1, 0)
- **projection**: Here we're using a perspective projection with a 45 degree field of view. We calculate the aspect ratio of the images, and we set the near clipping plane to 0.1, the far clipping plane to 100

To update the UBO before the draw is executed, we'll hop over to the draw function. We'll need to do what we did with our other buffers and map the memory for the uniform buffer, write to it, and then unmap. Since we've seen this before, I'll just show the code in its entirety

```rust
// update the uniform buffer with the MVP.
let uniform_memory = uniform_buffers[image_index as usize].1;
let dst = device
    .map_memory(
        uniform_memory,
        0,
        mem::size_of::<ModelViewProjection>().try_into().unwrap(),
        MemoryMapFlags::empty(),
    )
    .context("Failed to map uniform buffer memory.")?
    as *mut ModelViewProjection;
let src = mvp as *const ModelViewProjection;
ptr::copy_nonoverlapping(src, dst, 1);
device.unmap_memory(uniform_memory);
```

With this, we can now see that our square is actually a square! (finally)

![Correct Square](Correct%20Quad.png)

# Animation
Finally we can have an animated image, all we need to do is to simply rotate the model matrix a little each frame.

We will do this in the standard way of calculating the delta time between the last frame, and the current frame. We can then use this delta time along with a speed to rotate the square in a framerate-independent way.

In Rust we can get a timestamp like

```rust
let mut last_frame_timestamp = Instant::now();
```

So we start off with a timestamp initialised to the time that we start our application's event loop.

In order to calculate the elapsed time since the last frame and now, we can take another timestamp and calculate the elapsed time between the two as

```rust
let timestamp = Instant::now();
let elapsed = timestamp.duration_since(last_frame_timestamp).as_secs_f32();
```

The function **duration_since** will take an earlier timestamp and calculate a **Duration** between the two. We can choose how to extract information from this Duration but here we'll just get the total number of seconds as an f32, which handles partial seconds.

Once we have the elapsed time, we can rotate the model matrix by some amount - in this case we'll use a speed of 100 degrees per second

```rust
mvp.model *= Mat4::from_rotation_z(100.0_f32.to_radians() * elapsed);
```

Although notice that Mat4::from_rotation_z expects the angle in **radians** so we convert from degrees to radians by using the built-in Rust function on f32's, to_radians.

After rotating the model matrix, we update the timestamp of the previous frame, and request that the window be redrawn

```rust
last_frame_timestamp = timestamp;
window.request_redraw();
```

Running our program now, we can see a very nice **rotating** square!
