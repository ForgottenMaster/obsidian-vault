Now that we have the ability to render multiple meshes at different 3-D locations, we can notice that placing one mesh in front of another in world space does not necessarily cause the fragments behind to be hidden. Instead, the fragments appearing in front will be those of the triangles rendered last.

Without the concept of a depth buffer we would have to keep our triangles sorted by distance from the camera and then rendered back to front. This is a lot of work however and instead we would just like Vulkan to work out which fragments are closest as part of the rendering system.

# What is a depth buffer? #

A depth buffer (sometimes called a Z-buffer), is a separate data buffer from the colour pixel data, but is used to represent the distance of a given pixel from the camera.

The data stored is a single value per pixel (distance from camera), rather than colour data which is usually 4 pieces of data per pixel (red, green, blue, alpha).

As an example, here's a sample scene rendered into the colour buffer as we would see it, and the depth buffer storing the distances in greyscale.

# How it works in Vulkan #

To create a depth buffer (or more accurately in Vulkan, a depth image) we need to do the following steps, which will be detailed in the rest of the post:

1. Create a depth image resource
2. Allocate memory for the new depth image
3. Bind the allocated memory to the image handle
4. Create an image *view*
5. Add an attachment to the render pass for the depth image
6. Add the depth buffer to the framebuffer too
7. Configure the graphics pipeline to use a depth image
8. Set the clear values for the depth image

# Creating a depth image resource #

Creating an image resource in Vulkan is much like creating a buffer resource in Vulkan and the flow is essentially the same. The difference between images and buffers in Vulkan is that a buffer is holding data in a flat way, whereas an image can be 2-dimensional, or 3-dimensional and has different formats to store the data in.

In order to facilitate creating images in general - we make a create_image function which is analagous to the create_buffer function we already have.

The signature will look as follows:

```rust
fn create_image(
    instance: &Instance,
    device: &Device,
    physical_device: PhysicalDevice,
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
    tiling: ImageTiling,
    usage: ImageUsageFlags,
    initial_layout: ImageLayout,
    format: Format,
    flags: MemoryPropertyFlags,
) -> Result<(Image, DeviceMemory)>
```

The instance, device, and physical_device are the same as in creating a buffer so will just briefly mention the others:

- **width** - The width of the resulting 2-D image in pixels
- **height** - The height of the resulting 2-D image in pixels
- **tiling** - The method of tiling the image, how to store the data. This will almost always be ImageTiling::OPTIMAL.
- **usage** - How we are going to use the image
- **initial_layout** - The initial layout we would like to put the image into when created
- **format** - The format of the data in the image
- **flags** - Flags indicating the memory properties we'd like (e.g. device local, host coherant, etc.)

The first thing we need to do is to tell Vulkan to create the actual image itself with our specifications and usage flags. We can do this with the following snippet

```rust
let image = device
    .create_image(
        &ImageCreateInfo::builder()
            .image_type(ImageType::TYPE_2D)
            .format(format)
            .extent(
                Extent3D::builder()
                    .width(width)
                    .height(height)
                    .depth(1)
                    .build(),
            )
            .mip_levels(1)
            .array_layers(1)
            .samples(SampleCountFlags::TYPE_1)
            .tiling(tiling)
            .usage(usage)
            .initial_layout(initial_layout)
            .sharing_mode(SharingMode::EXCLUSIVE),
        None,
    )
    .context("Failed to create image.")?;
```

Note that we aren't using mip mapping levels at the moment, and no multisampling either. We also enforce that the image can only be used from a single queue at a time (SharingMode::EXCLUSIVE).

Once we have an image, we need to query Vulkan for information about what properties the memory is allowed to have in order to back the image - this is a simple call to get the memory requirements. We also go ahead and grab again the memory properties of the physical device as well

```rust
let memory_requirements = device.get_image_memory_requirements(image);
let memory_properties = instance.get_physical_device_memory_properties(physical_device);
```

We now need to find one of the memory types in memory_properties that actually fulfils our requirements. We have a handy function already for this which we used to do the same for buffers! It's simple enough then to do a find, erroring if nothing can be found

Once we've located a valid memory type, we allocate enough memory from it - and then bind the memory to the image

```rust
let memory_index =
    find_valid_memory_type_index(memory_properties, memory_requirements, flags)
        .ok_or_else(|| anyhow!("Failed to find a valid memory index for image."))?;
let memory = device
    .allocate_memory(
        &MemoryAllocateInfo::builder()
            .allocation_size(memory_requirements.size)
            .memory_type_index(memory_index as u32),
        None,
    )
    .context("Failed to allocate device memory for image.")?;
device
    .bind_image_memory(image, memory, 0)
    .context("Failed to bind image memory.")?;
```

Before we can actually create a specific function to allocate depth images specifically, we will take a small detour and implement a helper function able to take a list of preferred image formats, sorted by priority, and work out which one is supported.

The required features from the format will be different whether using optimal or linear tiling so we need to do a match on the tiling type.

The function is simple enough to list in its entirety here

```rust
fn get_best_image_format(
    instance: &Instance,
    physical_device: PhysicalDevice,
    formats: &[Format],
    tiling: ImageTiling,
    flags: FormatFeatureFlags,
) -> Option<Format> {
    formats.iter().copied().find(|format| {
        let properties =
            unsafe { instance.get_physical_device_format_properties(physical_device, *format) };
        match tiling {
            ImageTiling::OPTIMAL => properties.optimal_tiling_features.contains(flags),
            ImageTiling::LINEAR => properties.linear_tiling_features.contains(flags),
            _ => false,
        }
    })
}
```

That is, we iterate over the formats in the slice and for each, get the properties for that format from the physical device. We then compare the feature flags we passed in as required features against either the optimal or linear tiling features for the format.

Now we can write a function that creates depth images specifically!

Firstly look up a supported format from a prioritised list of a few depth/stencil formats (also telling it that it will be a depth stencil attachment)

```rust
let format = get_best_image_format(
    instance,
    physical_device,
    &[
        Format::D32_SFLOAT_S8_UINT,
        Format::D32_SFLOAT,
        Format::D24_UNORM_S8_UINT,
    ],
    tiling,
    FormatFeatureFlags::DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT,
)
.ok_or_else(|| anyhow!("Failed to get a valid image format."))?;
```

Then create the image and device memory

```rust
let (image, memory) = create_image(
    instance,
    device,
    physical_device,
    width,
    height,
    tiling,
    ImageUsageFlags::DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT,
    ImageLayout::UNDEFINED,
    format,
    MemoryPropertyFlags::DEVICE_LOCAL,
)
.context("Failed to create depth buffer image")?;
```

Finally, make sure to call this in main to ensure our depth image is created

```rust
let (depth_buffer_image, depth_buffer_image_memory, depth_buffer_format) =
    create_depth_buffer_image(
        &instance,
        &logical_device,
        physical_device,
        swapchain_extent.width,
        swapchain_extent.height,
        ImageTiling::OPTIMAL,
    )
    .context("Failed to create depth buffer.")?;
```

# Creating an image view #

Vulkan doesn't work directly with images during render passes, but instead works with image *views*. We will therefore need to make an image view to wrap the image we just created.

Handily this is super simple, barely an inconvenience as we have a function we were using to do this anyways!

```rust
let depth_image_view = create_image_view(
    depth_buffer_image,
    depth_buffer_format,
    ImageAspectFlags::DEPTH,
    &logical_device,
)
.context("Failed to create an image view for the depth buffer.")?;
```

---
# Updating the render pass #

When we created the render pass, we had to describe the form and function of any attachments we have as part of the pass. We initially only had colour information to output to, but now we have a depth image we need to add that as an attachment for the pass to use.

We first create an attachment description and add it to the list of attachment descriptions (so it's at index 1).

```rust
AttachmentDescription::builder()
    .format(depth_format)
    .samples(SampleCountFlags::TYPE_1)
    .load_op(AttachmentLoadOp::CLEAR)
    .store_op(AttachmentStoreOp::DONT_CARE)
    .stencil_load_op(AttachmentLoadOp::DONT_CARE)
    .stencil_store_op(AttachmentStoreOp::DONT_CARE)
    .initial_layout(ImageLayout::UNDEFINED)
    .final_layout(ImageLayout::DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL)
```

Most of these will be the same as the colour attachment however we pass a different format, and also tell it the final layout of the attachment is DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL.

Then we can add an attachment to the subpass

```rust
let depth_attachment_reference = AttachmentReference::builder()
    .attachment(1)
    .layout(ImageLayout::DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL);

.depth_stencil_attachment(&depth_attachment_reference)
```

Notice that we also use DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL for the subpass layout. Consequently the depth image is transitioned from UNDEFINED to DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL the first time the pass is entered, and then left in that layout.

---
# Enabling depth testing in the graphics pipeline #

Now that our render pass supports depth testing and we have the attachments bound for it - we need to tell the graphics pipeline that it will *actually* be doing depth testing as part of the pipeline.

This is a simple piece of code and the state can be setup as follows

```rust
let depth_stencil_state = PipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo::builder()
    .depth_test_enable(true)
    .depth_write_enable(true)
    .depth_compare_op(CompareOp::LESS_OR_EQUAL)
    .depth_bounds_test_enable(false);
```

We could choose a different comparison operation if we would like, but here we just use LESS_OR_EQUAL so that z values which are less or equal than the current value stored in the buffer will pass the test.

---
# Setting the clear values #

As part of recording the command buffers and actually performing the render pass, we need to tell it what to clear the values in the depth image to. We'll just use a value of 1 for now (probably should be either float MIN or MAX....not sure why tutorial uses 1).

The array of clear values we pass to the render now looks as follows

```rust
let clear_values = [
    ClearValue {
        color: ClearColorValue {
            float32: [0.6, 0.65, 0.4, 1.0],
        },
    },
    ClearValue {
        depth_stencil: ClearDepthStencilValue {
            depth: 1.0,
            stencil: 0,
        },
    },
];
```

And that's it! everything is now setup to use depth testing

---
# Demonstration #

Now we have depth testing enabled we should actually test that it's working. To do this we'll change the colors of the quads we have and their positions.

We'll then have 1 mesh (green) be translated over time into the screen, which we can do with the following line

```rust
meshes[1].push_model.0 *= Mat4::from_translation(Vec3::new(0.0, 0.0, -1.0) * elapsed);
```

If all is working well, we should see the green mesh in front of the red and hiding it, then when it passes through the red mesh we should see the red mesh in front of the green one. Running this does indeed produce the desired result

# A segfault! #

After running this and closing the window, I noticed we get a segfault. Removing the code for depth testing doesn't help so this was an existing issue.

After debugging, I found out it was the call to destroy the swapchain during clean-up!

After some Googling and tweaking of the code I realised it was due to the lifetime of the swapchain being managed by the windowing system we're using (winit) and that when we close the window, it seems to unload the swap chain extension.

We need to tell Vulkan to destroy the swapchain during the process of shutting the window down which, handily, winit has an event for!

Moving the call to destroy the swapchain out of clean-up and into the event loop under the following match arm works as intended

```rust
Event::LoopDestroyed => unsafe { swapchain_ext.destroy_swapchain(swapchain, None) }
```
