So far, we've learned how to chain functions together, and how to calculate the derivative of a function at a specific input value. We've also learned how to apply the chain rule when we are chaining multiple functions together. However, how do we calculate the derivative of a function, or chain of functions when a function has multiple inputs?.

As it turns out, we can calculate the derivative in the same way!, we just need to, in the case where there are multiple inputs, calculate the partial derivative with respect to the given parameter.

Lets start off with a single function, one that takes two inputs and returns a single output

![Single Function](Single%20Function%20With%20Multiple%20Inputs.png)

In such a function, the change in the output can be affected by a change in *either* input (x or y). Because of this, calculating the derivative with respect to x at a given value might result in a different value to what is given when calculating the derivative for input y. These are the partial derivatives of the function, where each partial derivative is how the output changes with a given change of the input (while keeping the other inputs constant).

The formulas for these partial derivatives can be given as:

$$ \frac {\partial f} {\partial x} = \lim_{\Delta \to 0} \frac {f(x + \Delta, y) - f(x - \Delta, y)} {2 \times \Delta} $$
$$ \frac {\partial f} {\partial y} = \lim_{\Delta \to 0} \frac {f(x, y + \Delta) - f(x, y - \Delta)} {2 \times \Delta} $$

# Applying the chain rule #

We can apply the chain rule in the same way when calculating the partial derivative of a composite function with respect to one of the inputs. Since the change in input causes a change in the input to the next function, which then causes a change in the input to the next, and so on, we will still do a backward pass the same way as we would with a single input. We just follow it back to the point where the input is given. For example with the following

![Multiple Functions](Chain%20Of%20Functions%20With%20Multiple%20Inputs.png)

We can see that the first function has two inputs whereas g and h have only 1 input. So there will be two partial derivatives for this composite function. These can be given as follows (applying the chain rule):

$$ (f \circ g \circ h)_x = f_x(x, y) \times g'(f(x, y)) \times h'(g(f(x, y))) $$
$$ (f \circ g \circ h)_y = f_y(x, y) \times g'(f(x, y)) \times h'(g(f(x, y))) $$

Note that here we are using [Legrange's Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notation_for_differentiation#Lagrange's_notation) as it can be cleaner than the Leibniz notation. In this notation we can use $f'(x)$ to denote the derivative of function f taking a single input, at value x.

With multiple inputs, the input we're describing the partial derivative of can be given as a subscript. e.g. $f_x(x, y)$ would be saying we are interested in how much a change in x will cause a change in the output of the function, at the point defined by the given values of x and y.

Overall the chain rule works the same way as a single input, except we are defining the input we're interested in when back propagating to work out the derivative.

Let's assume the following functions to calculate the derivative of a given 2 input function with respect to each of the inputs:

```rust
fn derivative_x(f: impl Fn(f64, f64) -> f64, x: f64, y: f64, delta: f64) -> f64 {
    (f(x + delta, y) - f(x - delta, y)) / (2.0 * delta)
}

fn derivative_y(f: impl Fn(f64, f64) -> f64, x: f64, y: f64, delta: f64) -> f64 {
    (f(x, y + delta) - f(x, y - delta)) / (2.0 * delta)
}
```

Along with the existence of the previous function, "derivative" which performs the same calculation but on a single input function. We can then calculate the derivatives of the composite function as shown above with the following functions:

```rust
fn derivative_x_chain(f: impl Fn(f64, f64) -> f64, g: impl Fn(f64) -> f64, h: impl Fn(f64) -> f64, x: f64, y: f64, delta: f64) -> f64 {
    // forward pass to calculate inputs
    let f_of_xy = f(x, y);
    let g_of_f_of_xy = g(f_of_xy);
    
    // backward pass to calculate partial derivatives
    let derivative_f = derivative_x(f, x, y, delta);
    let derivative_g = derivative(g, f_of_xy, delta);
    let derivative_h = derivative(h, g_of_f_of_xy, delta);
    
    // total derivative with respect to x of compound function
    derivative_f * derivative_g * derivative_h
}

fn derivative_y_chain(f: impl Fn(f64, f64) -> f64, g: impl Fn(f64) -> f64, h: impl Fn(f64) -> f64, x: f64, y: f64, delta: f64) -> f64 {
    // forward pass to calculate inputs
    let f_of_xy = f(x, y);
    let g_of_f_of_xy = g(f_of_xy);
    
    // backward pass to calculate partial derivatives
    let derivative_f = derivative_y(f, x, y, delta);
    let derivative_g = derivative(g, f_of_xy, delta);
    let derivative_h = derivative(h, g_of_f_of_xy, delta);
    
    // total derivative with respect to x of compound function
    derivative_f * derivative_g * derivative_h
}
```

For a runnable example of comparing calculating the derivative of a composite function both directly and via the chain rule, I have written a simple example on the [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=2c896cdaa4b0a3e126d2250c03c05392) which shows that the derivative calculated for a composite function directly results in the same value as a derivative calculated using the chain rule (both single and multiple input functions are tested).
