After trying to make a start on the next level of abstraction with the NeuralNetwork class, it's becoming apparent that dealing with lifetimes at the lower levels of abstraction (Operation and Layer trait objects) is causing it more difficult to make a nice abstraction at the upper level. We will take a brief interlude to look at what the problem is, and why we need to do a refactor at this point.

# The Problem #

The problem we run into with lifetimes is that we are required to keep the items for which we are borrowing around at least as long as the struct we're instantiating and when we use the literal reference extension "feature" of Rust, it's simply syntactic sugar.

For example, taking an example from one of the previous tests if we have a line such as:

```rust
let net = &mut [
    Operation::new_parameter(&WeightMultiply, weights),
    Operation::new_parameter(&BiasAdd, bias),
    Operation::new_basic(&Sigmoid),
    Operation::new_basic(&Linear),
];
```

Rust compiler will see that this is using temporary **literals**, and everything is all in the same scope, it can see that net here is a mutable reference, which means that nothing else can modify it, and more importantly it knows that **net can't be moved** due to the reference. The compiler is fine with this because it can desugar it by putting all these temporaries inside let bindings:

```rust
let _1 = WeightMultiply;
let _2 = BiasAdd;
let _3 = Sigmoid;
let _4 = Linear;
let mut _5 = [
    Operation::new_parameter(&_1, weights),
    Operation::new_parameter(&_2, bias),
    Operation::new_basic(&_3),
    Operation::new_basic(&_4)
];
let net = &mut _5;
```

And everything is happy here because the temporaries are literals and can be evaluated/verified to exist at **compile time**. It can be desugared into local variables, and doesn't have to worry about the network moving without the data inside because it can't be moved due to us only having access to a borrow.

However if we take a look at the following snippet, which is a very stripped down version what we would *like* to have for the next abstraction (the neural network):

```rust
struct Network<'a, T> {
    layers: Vec<Layer<'a, T>>
}

#[test]
fn test_throwaway() {
    let n: Network<'_, f64> = Network {
        layers: vec![Layer::new(1, &DenseLayerSetup::new(&Sigmoid))]
    };
    println!("{:?}", n.layers.len());
}
```

As we can see, we simply would like a Vec of Layers in our Network. However the important thing here is the following:

```rust
&DenseLayerSetup::new(&Sigmoid)
```

As mentioned in the previous test, Sigmoid is a **literal** and so the Rust compiler will extend it with the reference. However, in our case we aren't creating a DenseLayerSetup literal. To do so, we would need access, and specify all the fields inside a DenseLayerSetup, but we don't want to do this as it's exposing implementation details and can cause code to break if the structure of the.....structure changes.

Instead, we use the "new" associated method to create a new instance. The problem here then, is this is no longer a literal, it returns an instance of DenseLayerSetup created at *runtime* and not (as in the case of the above test with literal extension) at *compile time*.

Since it's a runtime expression, Rust can no longer use its lifetime extension desugaring to store off the temporary.

If we try to compile this code, we get the following error message indicating that the temporary returned from the new function doesn't live long enough:

# Solution #1 - Get the API user to store intermediate values #

The first of the two solutions we can use to get around this is simply to not care, continue using lifetimes all the way up the abstraction tree, and instead of having a *Vec* of layer instances, we instead have a *slice* of layer instances. In this solution we would change the definition of the Network structure to be thus:

```rust
struct Network<'a, T> {
    layers: &'a mut [Layer<'a, T>]
}
```

This will work, for sure, but it requires that the **caller** ensure that the storage for the slice is as long as the Network itself. This leads to code that isn't as succinct, such as:

```rust
let dense_layer_setup = DenseLayerSetup::new(&Sigmoid);
let mut layers = [Layer::new(1, &dense_layer_setup)];
let n: Network<'_, f64> = Network {
    layers: &mut layers
};
```

Which has a couple of issues:
1. It's not exactly nice to write. We would like to be able to write the whole network construct as a single expression.
2. We can't move the network around. Since it doesn't own the data, it's kind of pinned in place by virtue of the fact that the data it's borrowing is not movable (can't be moved while borrowed).

Note that neither is necessarily a *problem*, and in environments where we have no heap allocation it might even be necessarily to give stack control to the caller. However, we are trying to write a nice, usable API and as such, these limitations are not really acceptable for us.

# Solution #2 - Use boxing instead of borrows #

The other option is for the structures to *own* their component parts instead of borrowing them. This will also remove the requirement to have an explicit lifetime annotation since owning the data means it is guaranteed to live as long as the object itself.

In order to do this with Rust, we simply use the Box type. We can use the Box::new constructor to get a boxed/owned trait object rather than taking a reference to it. We can also use Vec rather than slice to get an owned collection of things. Thus, instead of doing the following:

```rust
let dense_layer_setup = DenseLayerSetup::new(&Sigmoid);
let mut layers = [Layer::new(1, &dense_layer_setup)];
let n: Network<'_, f64> = Network {
    layers: &mut layers
};
```

We would simply like to be able to do:

```rust
let n: Network<f64> = Network {
    layers: vec![Layer::new(
        1,
        Box::new(DenseLayerSetup::new(Box::new(Sigmoid))),
    )],
};
```

Replacing the references with boxed and owned instances. However, we can do one better by having the new function return the new instance already boxed. However, to make it explicit, we'll call it new_boxed as it's good practice for a function named "new" to return an instance of the exact type it's called on. The proposed API would then be something like:

```rust
let n: Network<f64> = Network {
    layers: vec![Layer::new(
        1,
        DenseLayerSetup::new_boxed(Sigmoid::new_boxed()),
    )],
};
```

We could go one step further and have the DenseLayerSetup internally construct the Sigmoid activation function trait object here for storage, and rely on generics. This would result in code looking like the following:

```rust
let n: Network<f64> = Network {
    layers: vec![Layer::new(
        1,
        DenseLayerSetup::new_boxed::<Sigmoid>(),
    )],
};
```

However there are a couple of issues with this:

1. It doesn't support operations/activation functions with additional setup. It relies entirely on the presence of the Default trait/method.
2. It requires all types implementing BasicOperation to then implement Default, which might not be wanted (they might want to ensure that data is provided to construct an instance).

Therefore we won't take this step, and stick with having it passed in.

---
# Solution #3 - Insanity #

There is a third solution which allows the network to be constructed with the nice syntax, and which can be moved around and such, however the code becomes much less readable, especially when looking at the types of layers/operations.

This solution is of course to use generics such that the type of the neural network overall statically encodes the concrete setup of the network.

I will be ignoring this as a viable solution, at least until finishing going through the book with a more traditional runtime solution, however I may revisit it in the future as a fun exercise.

---
# Solution Choice #

All things considered the best choice for this API for the time being is solution number 2. We are assuming we're running on hardware that has an allocator setup in some fashion, and we're assuming that the allocations will be very small.

Additionally, we only allocate once up front when constructing the neural network and after that don't need any further allocations. This solution also allows for easy API usage, especially if we add the new_boxed methods to remove the visual clutter of Box::new calls.

Following is a brief overview of the changes that need to be made.

#### OperationData/Operation ####

We change the OperationData structure so as to not accept a reference trait object but a boxed one. These BasicOperation and ParameterOperation instances are usually (if not always) going to be zero sized types, since they don't store any state themselves and only exist to act as a vtable for the actual calculations of the operation.

In Rust, boxing a ZST is guaranteed to **not** cause an allocation, therefore we introduce no allocations at this level (in general, but someone could still theoretically provide a BasicOperation or ParameterOperation that does have data).

We are able to remove the lifetime annotations since the trait object will now be owned rather than borrowed. Operation data will then change from:

```rust
enum OperationData<'a, T> {
    Basic(&'a dyn BasicOperation<T>),
    Parameter {
        operation: &'a dyn ParameterOperation<T>,
        parameter: Array<T, Ix2>,
        parameter_gradient: Option<Array<T, Ix2>>,
    },
}
```

To:

```rust
enum OperationData<T> {
    Basic(Box<dyn BasicOperation<T>>),
    Parameter {
        operation: Box<dyn ParameterOperation<T>>,
        parameter: Array<T, Ix2>,
        parameter_gradient: Option<Array<T, Ix2>>,
    },
}
```

Which then also lets us remove the explicit lifetime annotation from Operation as well, since it only existed to relay that information into the OperationData type being used. Therefore the new Operation will become:

```rust
pub struct Operation<T> {
    input: Option<Array<T, Ix2>>,
    input_gradient: Option<Array<T, Ix2>>,
    output: Option<Array<T, Ix2>>,
    data: OperationData<T>,
}
```

We also replace the references with boxed trait objects in the new_basic and new_parameter functions, but we don't need to show this here.

#### LayerSetup ####

The LayerSetup trait previously had an explicit lifetime parameter so as to be able to return a Vec of Operation with the correct lifetime. However we wish to remove this lifetime annotation which we now can do since Operation no longer takes one.

The new definition of the LayerSetup trait then becomes:

```rust
pub trait LayerSetup<T> {
    fn layer_setup(
        &self,
        num_neurons: usize,
        input: &Array<T, Ix2>,
        seed: &Option<u64>,
    ) -> Vec<Operation<T>>;
}
```

#### DenseLayerSetup ####

Previously this took a borrow to a BasicOperation to be used at the end of the layer (mimicking how OperationData::Basic had a borrow to one). As part of this lifetime annotation removal, we wish to hold a boxed instance (which doesn't cause an allocation generally if BasicOperation is a ZST).

The new definition of DenseLayerSetup then is simply:

```rust
pub struct DenseLayerSetup<T>(Box<dyn BasicOperation<T>>);
```

#### Layer ####

Previously the Layer struct held a borrow to the LayerSetup trait object like in the other cases, but we will replace this with a boxed trait object and can then remove the lifetime annotation as it's no longer needed.

The new definition of Layer then becomes:

```rust
pub struct Layer<T> {
    num_neurons: usize,
    operations: Option<Vec<Operation<T>>>,
    setup: Box<dyn LayerSetup<T>>,
    output: Option<Array<T, Ix2>>,
    seed: Option<u64>,
}
```

#### Loss ####

Finally, the Loss struct is also storing its vtable/trait object by borrow. We can do the same kind of replacement as elsewhere there too and end up with:

```rust
pub struct Loss<T> {
    implementation: Box<dyn LossImpl<T>>,
    prediction: Option<Array<T, Ix2>>,
    target: Option<Array<T, Ix2>>,
}
```

# Conclusion #

After changing these types, we then need to go through the compiler errors that we now get as a result of the change from reference to owned box. While we're doing this, we will make it so that all the appropriate types have a "new_boxed" associated method for convenience.

This means that instead of writing **Box::new(Foo::new())** people can then just write **Foo::new_boxed()** which is a little leaner.

After these changes we can now use the API in a way we expect, for example the following code now compiles where it wouldn't in the previous version:

```rust
struct Network<T> {
    layers: Vec<Layer<T>>,
}

#[test]
fn test_throwaway() {
    let n: Network<f64> = Network {
        layers: vec![Layer::new(
            1,
            DenseLayerSetup::new_boxed(Sigmoid::new_boxed()),
        )],
    };
    println!("{:?}", n.layers.len());
}
```
