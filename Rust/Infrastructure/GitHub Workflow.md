I recently found out how to add appropriate GitHub action workflows to a Rust project in a GitHub repository. It was surprisingly easy to do
with GitHub actions, and even lets you put a badge in the README.md file.

# Template Repository #

Luckily I stumbled upon this template repository containing exactly the GitHub workflows that I needed. In order to add the appropriate workflows to 
a Cargo project, clone this repository. The repository is located at: **https://github.com/BamPeers/rust-ci-github-actions-workflow

Click "Use this template" to create a new repository from it:

After this you'll be redirected to a page to setup the new repository as usual:

# Creating a CodeCov account #

**[CodeCov](https://app.codecov.io/)** is a fantastic site that hosts code coverage reports generated by tools (or in this case, by the GitHub workflows supplied by the template repository we used). It's free to use if either there are less than 5 users, or it's considered an open source repository.

Creating an account linked to your GitHub account is easy, just log in using your GitHub credentials, and authorize the app:

# Seeing your reports #

Once your CodeCov account is linked with GitHub, and the GitHub workflows run to produce your code coverage report, you can see those reports on the main dashboard:

Clicking on one of the repositories here will take you to a report overview page for that repository, showing the current/last run of code coverage in various formats:

The Sunburst diagram on the left hand side is interactable and lets you see which **files** have good or bad coverage at a glance.

At the bottom there is a directory navigation panel which also displays the code coverage percentage, and lets you drill down into each individual file. Clicking on an individual file will take you to a source code display and show exactly which lines are covered and which are not:

And you can see from this view, that only 1 line is red (uncovered by tests).

# Badges! #

Adding badges to the README.md file of your repository that reflect the current state of the workflows and/or CodeCov is easy. For the workflows, navigate to the workflows
panel again, and click on an individual workflow, then the hamburger menu, and finally the "Create Status Badge" option:

![Workflow Badge](Workflow%20Badge.png)

You'll then be presented with a popup with the markup that you can copy/paste into the README.md file

For CodeCov, the badge is just as easy to find. First click on one of the repositories, then Settings, and finally Badge. See the below screenshot as an example:

# Pop in the README.md #

Finally pop these markup codes into the README.md file of your repository and now everybody can see the status of your workflows and code coverage!
